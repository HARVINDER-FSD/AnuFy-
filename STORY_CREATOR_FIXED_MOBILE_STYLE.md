# Story Creator - Fixed & Mobile-Optimized âœ…

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Photo Not Displaying (FIXED âœ…)
**Problem**: Image would show for 1 second then disappear
**Root Cause**: Cloudinary upload was returning `undefined`, which cleared the selectedMedia state
**Solution**: 
- Use blob URL for instant preview
- Store original file separately
- Upload to Cloudinary only when submitting story
- No more disappearing images!

### 2. Mobile File Selection (FIXED âœ…)
**Problem**: Couldn't select photos on mobile
**Solution**:
- Removed `capture="environment"` attribute
- Now shows both "Take Photo" and "Choose from Gallery" options
- Better mobile file input handling

### 3. Preview Feature (ADDED âœ…)
**Problem**: No way to review story before posting
**Solution**:
- Added Preview button
- Two-step workflow: Edit â†’ Preview â†’ Share
- Can go back to edit from preview

### 4. Mobile-First Design (IMPROVED âœ…)
**Problem**: Looked like desktop app, not mobile Instagram
**Solution**:
- Full-screen image display with `object-cover`
- Instagram-style empty state with gradient icons
- Better button styling and layout
- Gradient backgrounds and blur effects

## New User Flow

## Technical Changes

### State Management
```typescript
const [selectedMedia, setSelectedMedia] = useState<string | null>(null) // Blob URL
const [selectedFile, setSelectedFile] = useState<File | null>(null) // Original file
const [showPreview, setShowPreview] = useState(false) // Preview mode
```

### File Handling
```typescript
// Create blob URL for instant preview
const objectUrl = URL.createObjectURL(file)
setSelectedMedia(objectUrl)
setSelectedFile(file)

// Upload on submit, not on select
await fetch('https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/...')
```

### Mobile Styling
- `object-cover` instead of `object-contain` for full-screen
- Gradient backgrounds: `from-black/90 via-black/70 to-transparent`
- Backdrop blur: `backdrop-blur-xl`
- Larger touch targets: `h-14` buttons
- Better spacing and padding
