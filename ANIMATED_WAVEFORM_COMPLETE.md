# 🎵 Animated Waveform Bars - Complete!

## What's New

The music trimmer now has **animated waveform bars** that bounce and pulse to the music beat, giving users visual feedback of the rhythm while trimming!

## Features

### 1. **Dynamic Bar Animation**
- Bars near the playhead bounce higher (up to 60% taller)
- Creates a "wave" effect that follows the music
- Smooth transitions between states

### 2. **Proximity-Based Animation**
- Bars within 1.5 seconds of the playhead get animated
- The closer to the playhead, the higher the bounce
- Other bars have a subtle pulse effect

### 3. **Visual Feedback**
- Selected range: Colorful gradient (yellow → pink → purple)
- Unselected range: Gray with reduced opacity
- Playing state: Bars animate and pulse
- Paused state: Static bars

### 4. **Smooth Transitions**
- 150ms transition when playing (responsive)
- 300ms transition when paused (smooth)
- Scale transform for extra bounce effect
- Ease-out timing for natural movement

## How It Works

```typescript
// Calculate distance from playhead
const distanceFromPlayhead = Math.abs(position - currentTime)
const isNearPlayhead = isPlaying && distanceFromPlayhead < 1.5

// Animate based on proximity
if (isNearPlayhead) {
  const proximity = 1 - (distanceFromPlayhead / 1.5)
  animatedHeight = baseHeight * (1 + proximity * 0.6) // Up to 60% taller
}
```

## Visual Effect

```
Playhead position: ▼
                   |
Bars:  ▂▃▅▇█▇▅▃▂  ← Wave effect follows playhead
       └─────┘
     Animated zone
```

## CSS Animations Added

Two new keyframe animations in `globals.css`:

1. **waveform-bounce**: Rhythmic bounce (0.6s)
2. **waveform-pulse**: Subtle pulse (0.8s)

## User Experience

✅ **Engaging interaction** - Bars respond to playback
✅ **Clear selection** - Colorful gradient shows trim range
✅ **Smooth performance** - Optimized transitions

## Technical Details

- 60 waveform bars across 30-second timeline
- Real-time height calculation based on playhead position
- Gradient colors for selected range
- Transform and opacity transitions
- No performance impact (CSS-based animations)
