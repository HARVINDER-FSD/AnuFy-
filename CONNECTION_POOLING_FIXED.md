# MongoDB Connection Pooling Fixed ✅

## Problem
Multiple API routes were creating new MongoDB connections for each request, causing:
- Connection timeouts (`querySrv ETIMEOUT`)
- Slow response times (40+ seconds)
- Connection pool exhaustion
- Intermittent failures

## Solution
Updated critical routes to use shared connection pooling from `lib/mongodb.ts`:

### Routes Fixed
1. ✅ `app/api/posts/instagram/route.ts` - Create post
2. ✅ `app/api/posts/instagram/feed/route.ts` - Feed posts
3. ✅ `components/stories/stories-bar.tsx` - Stories array validation

### Changes Made
**Before:**
```typescript
const client = await MongoClient.connect(MONGODB_URI);
const db = client.db();
// ... do work ...
await client.close();
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { connectToDatabase } from '@/lib/mongodb';

const { db } = await connectToDatabase();
// ... do work ...
// No close() - connection is reused
```

## Benefits
- **Faster**: Reuses existing connections (no 10s connection overhead)
- **Reliable**: Connection pooling prevents timeouts
- **Scalable**: Handles 50 concurrent connections efficiently
- **Auto-recovery**: Stale connections are automatically replaced

## Connection Pool Settings
```typescript
{
  maxPoolSize: 50,        // Max concurrent connections
  minPoolSize: 5,         // Always keep 5 connections ready
  maxIdleTimeMS: 60000,   // Close idle connections after 1 min
  serverSelectionTimeoutMS: 10000,  // Fail fast (10s)
  retryWrites: true,      // Auto-retry failed writes
  retryReads: true        // Auto-retry failed reads
}
```

## Remaining Work
There are still ~40 routes creating their own connections. Priority routes to fix:
- Stories routes (high traffic)
- Reels routes (high traffic)
- User profile routes
- Comments/likes routes

## Testing
The feed should now load in <2 seconds instead of 40+ seconds.

Test with:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:3001/api/posts/instagram/feed?limit=10
```

## Monitoring
Watch for these errors (should be gone now):
- ❌ `querySrv ETIMEOUT`
- ❌ `MongoServerSelectionError`
- ❌ `Connection pool exhausted`
