## Technical Implementation

### **Database Schema**

**Notifications Collection:**
```javascript
{
  user_id: ObjectId,
  type: 'story_mention' | 'story_repost',
  from_user_id: ObjectId,
  story_id: ObjectId,
  original_story_id: ObjectId, // For reposts
  message: String,
  read: Boolean,
  created_at: Date
}
```

**Stories Collection (Reposted):**
```javascript
{
  user_id: ObjectId,
  media_url: String,
  media_type: String,
  stickers: Array,
  texts: Array,
  filter: String,
  music: Object,
  is_repost: true,
  original_story_id: ObjectId,
  original_user_id: ObjectId,
  created_at: Date,
  expires_at: Date
}
```

### **Story Creator Integration**

**Upload Process:**
```javascript
1. Upload media to Cloudinary (20%)
2. Prepare story data (50%)
3. Create story via API (80%)
4. Notify mentioned users (90%)
5. Success & redirect (100%)
```

**Mention Detection:**
```javascript
const mentionStickers = stickersData.filter(s => s.type === 'mention')
const mentionedUsernames = mentionStickers.map(s => s.data.username)
```

### **Story Viewer Integration**

**Check if User is Mentioned:**
```javascript
const checkIfMentioned = () => {
  const mentionStickers = currentStory?.stickers?.filter(
    s => s.type === 'mention'
  ) || []
  
  const currentUsername = localStorage.getItem('username')
  
  const mentioned = mentionStickers.some(s => 
    s.data?.username === currentUsername
  )
  
  setIsMentioned(mentioned)
}
```

**Repost Handler:**
```javascript
const handleRepost = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(
    `/api/stories/${currentStory.id}/repost`,
    {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    }
  )
  
  if (response.ok) {
    toast({ title: "Story reposted!" })
    onClose()
  }
}
```

## UI/UX Design

## Error Handling
