## Authorization Logic

### Ownership Detection

const isOwner = currentUserId === content.user.id || content.isOwner
```

### Conditional Rendering
- **Owner sees:** Delete option
- **Non-owner sees:** Report option
- **Not logged in:** No dropdown menu

## Component Props

### PostCard
```typescript
interface PostCardProps {
  post: Post
  onDelete?: (postId: string) => void
  currentUserId?: string
  // ... other props
}
```

### ReelPlayer
```typescript
interface ReelPlayerProps {
  reel: Reel
  onDelete?: (reelId: string) => void
  currentUserId?: string
  // ... other props
}
```

### StoryViewer
```typescript
interface StoryViewerProps {
  stories: Story[]
  onDelete?: (storyId: string) => void
  currentUserId?: string
  // ... other props
}
```

```typescript
DELETE /api/posts/:postId
```
