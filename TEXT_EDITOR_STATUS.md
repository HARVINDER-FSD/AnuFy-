## 🎯 Recommended Approach

Given the scope, I recommend:

### Option A: Implement Core Features Only
Focus on the most critical features:
1. ✅ Basic text editor (DONE)
2. 🚧 Inline editing (IN PROGRESS)
3. ⏳ Text animations (NEXT)

**Time:** 8-10 hours
**Impact:** High user value

### Option B: Full Implementation
Implement everything as requested:
1. Inline editing
2. Text animations
3. Advanced color picker
4. @Mentions
5. Location

**Time:** 16-21 hours
**Impact:** Complete Instagram parity

### Option C: Phased Rollout
Implement and test one phase at a time:
- Week 1: Inline editing + animations
- Week 2: Color picker + mentions
- Week 3: Location + polish

**Time:** 3 weeks
**Impact:** Stable, tested features

## 💡 Current Recommendation

**Start with Phase 1 (Inline Editing)** because:
- Most requested feature
- Highest user impact
- Foundation for other features
- Can be completed in one session

Once Phase 1 is working, we can:
- Test on mobile
- Get user feedback
- Decide on next priorities

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Implement inline editing** (tap canvas to add text)
2. **Test on mobile device**
3. **Add text animations** (if time permits)
4. **Iterate based on feedback**

Would you like me to:
- **A)** Continue with Phase 1 implementation now?
- **B)** Create a simplified version with all features?
- **C)** Focus on specific features you need most?

Let me know and I'll proceed accordingly!
