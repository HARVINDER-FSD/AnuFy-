# âœ… Full Songs Integration Complete!

## What Changed

Your music trimmer now supports **FULL-LENGTH SONGS** instead of just 30-second previews!

## Quick Setup (2 minutes)

### Get Spotify API Access (Free)

1. Visit: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
2. Create an app (any name)
3. Copy Client ID & Client Secret

   ```env
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_id_here
