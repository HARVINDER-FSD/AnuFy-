# ✅ Green Tap Highlight Removed

## What Was Fixed

Removed the green/blue tap highlight that appears when tapping icons and buttons on mobile devices across the entire app.

## Changes Made

### Global CSS Update (`app/globals.css`)

Added CSS rules to disable tap highlights:

```css
* {
  -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent;
  -webkit-touch-callout: none;
}

button, a, input, textarea, select, [role="button"], [tabindex] {
  -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent;
  -webkit-touch-callout: none;
}
```

## What This Does

### Removes:
- ✅ Green tap highlight on Android
- ✅ Blue tap highlight on iOS
- ✅ Gray tap highlight on other devices
- ✅ Long-press callout menu on iOS

### Applies To:
- All buttons
- All links
- All input fields
- All interactive elements
- Icons and icon buttons
- Navigation items
- Story viewer controls
- Post interactions (like, comment, share)
- Chat messages
- Profile actions

## Result

Your app now has a clean, professional look without any distracting tap highlights - just like Instagram and other modern apps!

### Before:
- Tap icon → Green/blue flash appears
- Looks unprofessional
- Distracting user experience

### After:
- Tap icon → Clean, instant response
- Professional appearance
- Smooth user experience

## Browser Support

This works on:
- ✅ iOS Safari
- ✅ Android Chrome
- ✅ Android Firefox
- ✅ Samsung Internet
- ✅ All WebView-based apps
- ✅ Desktop browsers (no effect, but harmless)

## Note

The tap highlight removal doesn't affect:
- Button hover states (on desktop)
- Active states
- Focus indicators (for accessibility)
- Your custom animations and transitions

It only removes the default browser tap highlight!
