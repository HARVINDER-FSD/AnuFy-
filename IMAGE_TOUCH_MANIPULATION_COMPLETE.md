## 💻 Technical Implementation:

### Touch Detection:
```typescript
const handleImageTouchStart = (e: React.TouchEvent) => {
  // Don't manipulate if touching text or sticker
  if ((e.target as HTMLElement).closest('[data-element-type]')) {
    return
  }
  
  if (e.touches.length === 1) {
    // Single finger - pan
  } else if (e.touches.length === 2) {
    // Two fingers - zoom & rotate
  }
}
```

### Transform Application:
```typescript
transform: `translate(${imagePosition.x}px, ${imagePosition.y}px) 
           scale(${scale}) 
           rotate(${imageRotation}deg)`
```

### Smart Element Separation:
```html
<div data-element-type="text">...</div>
<div data-element-type="sticker">...</div>
```
