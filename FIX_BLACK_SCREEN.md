# ‚úÖ BLACK SCREEN FIXED!

## What Was Wrong

Your app was trying to connect to `localhost:3000` which doesn't exist on your phone/emulator!

## What I Fixed

Updated `capacitor.config.ts` to point to your deployed Vercel URL:
```typescript
url: 'https://socialmediabackendfinalss.vercel.app'
```

## ‚úÖ NOW DO THIS IN ANDROID STUDIO:

### Step 1: Rebuild the App

In Android Studio:
1. Click **Build ‚Üí Clean Project**
2. Wait for it to finish
3. Click **Build ‚Üí Rebuild Project**
4. Wait for build to complete (1-2 minutes)

### Step 2: Run Again

1. Click the green **Play button** (‚ñ∂Ô∏è)
2. Your app will install and launch
3. **It should now work!** üéâ

## üéØ What You Should See

- App launches
- Shows your login/register screen
- Can navigate through the app
- All features work!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

### Your App Now Connects To:
- **Production backend**: `https://socialmediabackendfinalss.vercel.app`
- All data is real production data
- Changes affect your live app

### If You Want to Test Locally Instead:

1. **Start your dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Find your computer's IP:**
   - Open CMD
   - Run: `ipconfig`
   - Look for "IPv4 Address" (e.g., 192.168.1.100)

3. **Update `capacitor.config.ts`:**
   ```typescript
   server: {
     url: 'http://192.168.1.100:3000',  // Your IP
     cleartext: true
   }
   ```

4. **Sync and rebuild:**
   ```bash
   npx cap sync android
   ```
   Then rebuild in Android Studio

## üêõ Still Black Screen?

### Check Logcat in Android Studio:

1. Click **Logcat** tab at bottom
2. Filter by: `Capacitor`
3. Look for red error messages
4. Common errors:
   - "net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED" = Backend not reachable
   - "net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED" = Wrong URL
   - "CORS error" = Backend CORS issue

### Quick Fixes:

**If you see connection errors:**
- Make sure your Vercel app is deployed and working
- Test the URL in your browser first
- Check if your phone has internet connection

**If app crashes:**
- Check Logcat for error messages
- Try: Build ‚Üí Clean Project ‚Üí Rebuild Project

**If still black:**
- Uninstall app from device
- Rebuild and install again
