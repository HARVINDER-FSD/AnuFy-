# ✅ FOUND THE PROBLEM - Wrong Port!

## 🎯 The Issue

Your server is running on **PORT 3001**, but you're trying to access **PORT 3000**!

---

## 🚀 THE FIX - Use Correct URL

### ❌ WRONG (What you're using):
```
http://localhost:3000/feed
```

### ✅ CORRECT (What you should use):
```
http://localhost:3001/feed
```

**Just change 3000 to 3001!**

---

## 📊 What Happened

When you started the server, it said:
```
⚠ Port 3000 is in use, trying 3001 instead.
✓ Ready in 21.9s
- Local: http://localhost:3001
```

**This means:**
- Port 3000 was already occupied
- Next.js automatically used port 3001
- Server is running fine on 3001
- You need to access 3001, not 3000!

---

## 🎯 Open These URLs

### Main Pages:
```
http://localhost:3001/
http://localhost:3001/feed
http://localhost:3001/messages
```

### Chat:
```
http://localhost:3001/messages/[conversationId]
```

---

## ✅ What You'll See

After using the correct port (3001):

- ✅ Pages load (no 404)
- ✅ CSS compiles and loads
- ✅ Beautiful styling appears
- ✅ Everything works!

---

## 🔧 Optional: Free Port 3000

If you want to use port 3000 instead:

### Step 1: Stop Current Server
```
Ctrl+C
```

### Step 2: Kill Process on Port 3000
```powershell
Get-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3000).OwningProcess | Stop-Process -Force
```

### Step 3: Start Server Again
```bash
npm run dev
```

Now it will use port 3000!
