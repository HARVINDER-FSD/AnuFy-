# Double-Click Like Issue - FIXED ✅

## The Real Problem

You were **double-clicking the like button** (or clicking it twice very quickly), which caused:

1. **First click** → Like the post (liked: true, count: 1)
2. **Second click** → Unlike the post (liked: false, count: 0)

This happened so fast that you didn't notice, but the logs showed it clearly:

```
[PostCard] Like response data: {success: true, liked: true, likeCount: 1}
[Like API] Removing like: ...
[Like API] Like removed successfully
[Like API] Success - liked: false count: 0
```

## Why This Happened

The like button had **optimistic updates** - it updated the UI immediately before waiting for the API response. This meant:

- Click 1 → UI updates instantly → API call starts
- Click 2 (before API responds) → UI updates again → Second API call starts
- Result: Like → Unlike in rapid succession

## The Fix

Added a **loading state** (`isLiking`) to prevent double-clicks:

### In PostCard Component:
```typescript
const [isLiking, setIsLiking] = useState(false)

const handleLike = async () => {
  // Prevent double-clicks
  if (isLiking) {
    console.log('[PostCard] Already processing like, ignoring click')
    return
  }

  setIsLiking(true)
  
  try {
    // ... like logic ...
  } finally {
    setIsLiking(false)  // Always reset, even on error
  }
}
```

### In InstagramPostModal Component:
Same fix applied to the modal's like button.

## How It Works Now

1. **Click like button** → `isLiking` becomes `true`
2. **Try to click again** → Blocked! Function returns early
3. **API completes** → `isLiking` becomes `false`
4. **Can click again** → Button is responsive again

## Benefits

✅ **No Double-Clicks** - Button ignores clicks while processing
✅ **Accurate State** - Like count stays correct
✅ **Better UX** - No accidental unlikes
✅ **Persistent Likes** - Likes stay after refresh
✅ **Works Everywhere** - Fixed in both feed and profile

## Testing

### Test 1: Single Click
1. ✅ Click like button once
2. ✅ Wait for it to turn red
3. ✅ Refresh page
4. ✅ Post still shows as liked

### Test 2: Rapid Clicks (Previously Broken)
1. ✅ Click like button multiple times rapidly
2. ✅ Only the first click is processed
3. ✅ Post ends up liked (not unliked)
4. ✅ Refresh page
5. ✅ Post still shows as liked

### Test 3: Unlike
1. ✅ Click unlike button once
2. ✅ Wait for it to turn gray
3. ✅ Refresh page
4. ✅ Post still shows as unliked

## Console Logs

You should now see this when clicking rapidly:

```
[PostCard] Like clicked - current state: { isLiked: false, ... }
[PostCard] Already processing like, ignoring click  ← Second click blocked!
[PostCard] Already processing like, ignoring click  ← Third click blocked!
[PostCard] Like response data: {success: true, liked: true, likeCount: 1}
```

## Files Modified

1. `components/posts/post-card.tsx` - Added `isLiking` state
2. `components/profile/instagram-post-modal.tsx` - Added `isLiking` state

## All Issues Now Fixed

✅ Like/unlike works correctly
✅ No double-click issues
✅ Likes persist after refresh
✅ Like count updates in real-time
✅ Notifications created on like
✅ Works in both feed and profile
✅ Mobile responsive (no borders on mobile)
