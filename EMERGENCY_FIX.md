# 🚨 EMERGENCY FIX - Your App Looks Unstyled

## I Can See The Problem!

Your app has **ZERO styling** because Tailwind CSS is not compiling. This is 100% because the server hasn't been restarted with the new configuration.

---

## 🔥 DO THIS RIGHT NOW - EXACT STEPS

### Step 1: Find Your Terminal

Find the terminal window where you ran `npm run dev`

### Step 2: STOP THE SERVER

**Press these keys together:**
```
Ctrl + C
```

**Wait until you see:**
```
Gracefully shutting down...
```

**If it doesn't stop, press `Ctrl+C` again!**

### Step 3: Make SURE It's Stopped

Run this command:
```powershell
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3000 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

**If you see output** = server still running!

**Kill it:**
```powershell
Get-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3000).OwningProcess | Stop-Process -Force
```

### Step 4: Clear Cache

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next
```

### Step 5: START FRESH

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 6: WAIT!

**DO NOT OPEN BROWSER YET!**

Wait until you see:
```
✓ Ready in X.Xs
- Local: http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 7: Open Browser

**ONLY AFTER seeing "Ready":**
```
http://localhost:3000/feed
```

### Step 8: Hard Refresh

Press:
```
Ctrl + Shift + R
```

## 🎯 Why This Happened

# 3. Delete cache
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next

# 4. Delete node cache
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules/.cache -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# 5. Reinstall (if needed)
npm install --force
