# üîç Debug Steps - Modal Not Opening

## **Step 1: Refresh Browser**

**IMPORTANT:** Hard refresh to clear cache:
- **Windows:** Press `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- **Mac:** Press `Cmd + Shift + R`

---

## **Step 2: Open Browser Console**

Press **F12** or **Right-click ‚Üí Inspect ‚Üí Console**

---

## **Step 3: Go to Profile**

Navigate to `/profile` page

---

## **Step 4: Check Console Messages**

You should see:
```
Test posts loaded: 3
PostGrid rendered with posts: 3
```

**If you see "0 posts":** The test data isn't loading. Restart dev server.

---

## **Step 5: Look at the Page**

You should see:
- ‚úÖ **3 test posts** in a grid
- ‚úÖ **Images** from picsum.photos
- ‚úÖ **Hover effect** when you move mouse over them

**If you don't see posts:** Check console for errors

---

## **Step 6: Click a Post**

Click on any of the 3 test posts.

**Check console for:**
```
Post clicked: test-1
Opening modal for post: {object}
Selected post set
```

---

## **Step 7: What Should Happen**

When you click:
1. **Screen darkens** (black overlay appears)
2. **Modal appears** in center
3. **Post shows** with full details
4. **X button** visible in top-right
5. **Three dots menu** visible

---

## **If Modal Still Doesn't Open:**

### Check 1: Is the overlay appearing?

Look for a dark overlay covering the screen. If YES but no content:
- The modal is rendering but PostCard might have an error
- Check console for red errors

### Check 2: Nothing happens at all?

Run this in console:
```javascript
// Check if modal element exists
document.querySelector('.fixed.inset-0.z-50')
```

If it returns `null`, the modal isn't rendering.

### Check 3: Console errors?

Look for errors in red. Common ones:
- `Cannot read property 'id' of undefined`
- `PostCard is not defined`
- `useAuth is not a function`

---

## **Quick Visual Test:**

Add this temporarily to see if modals work at all.

In `app/profile/page.tsx`, add this button:

```typescript
<button 
  onClick={() => alert('Click works!')}
  className="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded"
>
  TEST CLICK
</button>
```

If this alert works, clicks are fine. The issue is with the modal component.

---

## **Nuclear Option: Simple Alert Test**

Replace the modal in `post-grid.tsx` temporarily:

```typescript
const handlePostClick = (post: Post) => {
  alert(`Clicked post: ${post.id}\n\nIf you see this, clicks work!\n\nThe issue is with the modal rendering.`)
  setSelectedPost(post)
}
```

If you see the alert, we know:
- ‚úÖ Clicks work
- ‚úÖ Data is there
- ‚ùå Modal rendering is the problem

3. **What appears in console when you click?**
