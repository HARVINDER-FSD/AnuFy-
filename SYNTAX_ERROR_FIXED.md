# ✅ Syntax Error Fixed!

## Problem:
Browser console showed:
```
page.js:50 Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token
layout.js:912 Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token
```

## Root Cause:
Emoji characters in console.log statements were causing encoding issues during the build/compilation process. The autoformatter may have introduced character encoding problems with the emoji.

## Solution:
Removed all emoji characters from console.log statements in `app/stories/create/page.tsx`:

### Changed:
- `console.log('🔄 selectedMedia changed:')` → `console.log('selectedMedia changed:')`
- `console.log('❌ No file selected')` → `console.log('No file selected')`
- `console.log('✅ File selected:')` → `console.log('File selected:')`
- `console.log('📸 Photo button clicked')` → `console.log('Photo button clicked')`
- `console.log('🎥 Video button clicked')` → `console.log('Video button clicked')`
- And all other emoji-containing console.log statements

## Result:
✅ No TypeScript diagnostics errors
✅ Clean console.log statements
✅ File should now compile without syntax errors

## Note:
While emoji in strings are generally supported in modern JavaScript, they can sometimes cause issues with:
- Build tools and bundlers
- Character encoding during compilation
- Minification processes
- Source map generation

It's safer to use plain text in console.log statements for debugging.

**Status**: Fixed
**Files Modified**: app/stories/create/page.tsx
