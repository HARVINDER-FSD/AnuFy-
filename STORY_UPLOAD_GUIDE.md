# ðŸ“¸ Story Upload - User Guide

## âœ… Upload Options ARE Available!

### Where to Find Upload Buttons:

**When you first open the story creator:**
1. You'll see a Camera icon
2. Text: "Select a photo or video to create your story"
3. Two buttons:
   - **Photo** button (with image icon)
   - **Video** button (with video icon)

### How to Upload:

**Option 1: Photo**
1. Tap the "Photo" button
2. Select image from your device
3. Image uploads to Cloudinary
4. Preview appears

**Option 2: Video**
1. Tap the "Video" button
2. Select video from your device
3. Video uploads to Cloudinary
4. Preview appears with controls

### If You Don't See Upload Buttons:

**Possible Reasons:**
1. âœ… Media already selected (buttons hide after upload)
2. âœ… Page still loading
3. âœ… Not authenticated (redirects to login)

**Solution:**
- If media is already selected, you'll see:
  - Your photo/video preview
  - AI Create button (top right)
  - Tool icons (bottom)
  - Share button (bottom)

### To Upload New Media:

**If you want to change the photo/video:**
1. Currently, you need to refresh the page
2. Or we can add a "Change Media" button

## ðŸŽ¨ After Upload:

Once media is uploaded, you'll see:
- âœ… Full preview of your photo/video
- âœ… AI Create button (lightning bolt)
- âœ… Tool icons: Text, Draw, Sticker, Music, Filter
- âœ… Share to Story button

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details:

```typescript
// File inputs are hidden but functional
<input type="file" accept="image/*" />  // Photo
<input type="file" accept="video/*" />  // Video

// Buttons trigger file input
onClick={() => fileInputRef.current?.click()}
```
