## What Fixed It

You switched from **Node.js v22.16.0** to **Node.js v20** (LTS)

This resolved the webpack module error:
- ❌ Node 22 + Next.js 14 = Webpack errors
- ✅ Node 20 + Next.js 14 = Works perfectly!

---

## Current Setup

- ✅ **Node.js:** v20.x LTS
- ✅ **Next.js:** 14.2.5
- ✅ **React:** 18.3.1
- ✅ **Status:** Running smoothly

- ✅ No webpack errors
- ✅ No module resolution errors
- ✅ Fast compilation (5-7 seconds)
- ✅ Production ready

## Next Steps

### 1. Restore Your Features

Now that the app works, you can gradually add back your components:

#### Add ThemeProvider
```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from "@/components/theme-provider"

<ThemeProvider storageKey="anufy-theme">
  {children}
</ThemeProvider>
```

#### Add AuthProvider
```tsx
import { AuthProvider } from "@/components/auth/auth-provider"

<ThemeProvider storageKey="anufy-theme">
  <AuthProvider>
    {children}
  </AuthProvider>
</ThemeProvider>
```

#### Add AppLayout
```tsx
import { AppLayout } from "@/components/layout/app-layout"

<AuthProvider>
  <AppLayout>
    {children}
  </AppLayout>
</AuthProvider>
```

#### Add Other Components
- Toaster
- LoadingBar
- SplashScreen
- Analytics (if needed)

### 2. Update Your Page

Replace the "Hello World" with your actual home page logic:

```tsx
// app/page.tsx
"use client"

import { useEffect } from "react"
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation"
import { useAuth } from "@/components/auth/auth-provider"

export default function HomePage() {
  const router = useRouter()
  const { user, loading } = useAuth()

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!loading) {
      if (user) {
        router.push('/feed')
      } else {
        router.push('/login')
      }
    }
  }, [user, loading, router])

  return <div>Loading...</div>
}
```

### 3. Test Each Addition

After adding each component:
1. Save the file
2. Check browser for errors
3. If error appears, that component needs fixing
4. If no error, continue to next component

### Clear Cache When Needed
If you see weird errors:
```bash
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
