# Story Preview Feature - Fixed âœ…

## Problem
When creating a story, clicking "Share to Story" would immediately post without showing a preview or allowing you to review/edit your work.

## Solution
Added a **Preview Mode** with two-step workflow:

### Step 1: Edit Mode (Default)
- Add media (photo/video)
- Use all editing tools (text, draw, stickers, music, filters)
- See live preview of your edits
- Two buttons at bottom:
  - **Cancel** - Clear everything and start over
  - **Preview** - Enter preview mode

### Step 2: Preview Mode
- See final result without editing tools
- Clean preview of your story
- Two buttons at bottom:
  - **Edit** - Go back to editing
  - **Share to Story** - Post your story

## Changes Made

### Basic Story Creator (`app/stories/create/page.tsx`)
- Added `showPreview` state
- Tools bar hidden in preview mode
- Tool options panel hidden in preview mode
- New button layout:
  - Edit mode: Cancel + Preview buttons
  - Preview mode: Edit + Share buttons

### Advanced Story Creator (`app/stories/create-advanced/page.tsx`)
- Added `showPreview` state
- Added `isSubmitting` state for loading feedback
- Tools bar hidden in preview mode
- Tool options hidden in preview mode
- Same button layout as basic creator
