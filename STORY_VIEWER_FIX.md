# âœ… Story Viewer Fix

## Problem
Stories were created successfully and showing in the stories bar, but clicking on them didn't open/display the stories.

## Root Cause
The `/app/stories/page.tsx` was using hardcoded `mockStories` data instead of fetching real stories from the API.

```typescript
// BEFORE - Hardcoded fake stories:
const mockStories = [
  {
    id: "1",
    user: { username: "alice_dev", ... },
    media: "/placeholder.jpg", // Fake image!
  }
]
```

## Solution Applied

### Fixed `/app/stories/page.tsx`

1. **Added real API fetching:**
   ```typescript
   useEffect(() => {
     const fetchStories = async () => {
       const response = await fetch('/api/stories')
       const data = await response.json()
       setStories(data) // Real stories from database!
     }
     fetchStories()
   }, [user])
   ```

2. **Added story grouping by user:**
   - Groups multiple stories from same user
   - Allows viewing all of a user's stories in sequence

3. **Added URL parameter support:**
   - `/stories` - Shows all stories
   - `/stories?user={userId}` - Opens specific user's stories
   - Automatically jumps to correct user when clicked from stories bar

4. **Added proper data formatting:**
   - Converts database format to StoryViewer component format
   - Handles image and video types
   - Formats timestamps properly

5. **Added empty state:**
   - Shows "No stories available" if no stories exist
   - Provides "Back to Feed" button

## Technical Details

    acc[story.user_id] = {
      user_id: story.user_id,
      username: story.username,
      stories: []
    }
  }
  acc[story.user_id].stories.push(story)
  return acc
}, {})
```

### URL Parameter Handling:
```typescript
const viewingUserId = searchParams.get('user')
if (viewingUserId) {
  const userIndex = groupedArray.findIndex(g => g.user_id === viewingUserId)
  setCurrentIndex(userIndex) // Jump to this user's stories
}
```
