# 🚨 RESTART YOUR SERVER NOW! 🚨

## You're Still Getting the Error Because:

**The server is still running with the OLD configuration!**

## What I Just Fixed:

1. ✅ **Next.js Config** (`next.config.mjs`) - Increased body size to 50MB
2. ✅ **Upload Route** (`app/api/upload/route.ts`) - Added route-specific config
3. ✅ **File Validation** - Added size checks with clear errors

## 🔴 CRITICAL: YOU MUST RESTART THE SERVER

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

#### 1. **Stop the Development Server**
In your terminal where the server is running:
- Press **`Ctrl + C`**
- Wait for it to fully stop

#### 2. **Start the Server Again**
```bash
npm run dev
```

#### 3. **Hard Refresh Your Browser**
- Press **`Ctrl + F5`** (Windows)
- Or **`Cmd + Shift + R`** (Mac)
- Or clear cache and refresh

### Why This is Required:

```
Configuration files are loaded at startup
    ↓
Changes to next.config.mjs don't apply during hot reload
    ↓
Must restart server to pick up new settings
    ↓
After restart, new 50MB limit will be active
```

## What Will Happen After Restart:

### ✅ BEFORE RESTART (Current State):
- Server using old ~4MB limit
- Your 17.8MB video exceeds limit
- Buffer overflow error
- "offset out of range" error
- **REELS DON'T WORK** ❌

### ✅ AFTER RESTART (New State):
- Server using new 50MB limit
- Your 17.8MB video is under limit
- No buffer overflow
- Upload works perfectly
- **REELS WORK!** ✓

## Quick Checklist:

- [ ] Stop server (Ctrl+C)
- [ ] Start server (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)
- [ ] Try uploading reel
- [ ] Should work now! ✓

## If Still Not Working After Restart:

### 1. Check Terminal Output:
Look for any errors when server starts:
```bash
✓ Ready in 2.3s
○ Local: http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Verify Config Loaded:
No errors about `next.config.mjs`

### 3. Check File Size:
Make sure video is actually under 50MB:
- Right-click file → Properties
- Check size in MB

### 4. Try Smaller File First:
Test with a small video (<5MB) to verify it works

### 5. Check Console:
Open browser DevTools (F12) and check for errors

## Files That Were Modified:

1. **`next.config.mjs`**
   ```javascript
   api: {
     bodyParser: {
       sizeLimit: '50mb',
     },
   },
   ```

2. **`app/api/upload/route.ts`**
   ```typescript
   export const config = {
     api: {
       bodyParser: {
         sizeLimit: '50mb',
       },
     },
   };
   export const runtime = 'nodejs';
   export const maxDuration = 60;
   ```

## Expected Result After Restart:

### Upload Flow:
```
1. Select video file (17.8MB)
2. Click upload
3. File sent to server
4. Server accepts (under 50MB limit) ✓
5. Uploads to Cloudinary ✓
6. Returns URL ✓
7. Reel created ✓
8. Success! ✓
```

## Common Mistakes:

### ❌ DON'T:
- Just refresh browser without restarting server
- Use hot reload (Ctrl+S) - won't work for config
- Edit files while server is running and expect it to work

### ✅ DO:
- Stop server completely (Ctrl+C)
- Restart server (`npm run dev`)
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)
- Test with actual file upload

## Terminal Commands:

### Windows PowerShell:
```powershell
# Stop server: Ctrl+C
# Then run:
npm run dev
```

### Mac/Linux:
```bash
# Stop server: Ctrl+C
# Then run:
npm run dev
```

## Browser Refresh:

### Hard Refresh:
- **Windows:** `Ctrl + F5` or `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- **Mac:** `Cmd + Shift + R`
- **Chrome:** `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` → Clear cache

## Verification Steps:

After restarting:

1. **Check server started:**
   ```
   ✓ Ready in 2.3s
   ○ Local: http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Open app in browser:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Login if needed

3. **Try creating reel:**
   - Go to Create Reel page
   - Select video file
   - Upload should work now ✓

4. **Check for success:**
   - No "offset out of range" error
   - Upload progresses
   - Reel created successfully

## Still Having Issues?

### Debug Checklist:

1. **Server fully restarted?**
   - Did you see "Ready" message?
   - Is it running on port 3000?

2. **Config file correct?**
   - Check `next.config.mjs` has the changes
   - No syntax errors?

3. **File size OK?**
   - Is video actually under 50MB?
   - Check file properties

4. **Browser cache cleared?**
   - Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
   - Or clear all cache

5. **No other errors?**
   - Check terminal for errors
   - Check browser console (F12)

## Summary:

### The Fix is Complete, But:
**YOU MUST RESTART THE SERVER FOR IT TO WORK!**

### Right Now:
```
Server: Running with OLD config (4MB limit)
Your File: 17.8MB
Result: ERROR ❌
```

### After Restart:
```
Server: Running with NEW config (50MB limit)
Your File: 17.8MB
Result: SUCCESS ✓
```
