# âœ… FIXED! Ready to Test

## What Was Wrong
Your profile picture wasn't being uploaded to Cloudinary - only a preview was created in the browser. The database never got a real image URL.

## What I Fixed
Now the image is **actually uploaded to Cloudinary** and the **real URL is saved to the database**.

## Test It Now (2 Minutes)

### 1. Start Servers
```powershell
# Terminal 1
cd api-server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2
npm run dev
```

### 2. Upload Picture
1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/profile/edit`
2. Click camera icon
3. Select image
4. Click "Save Changes"
5. Watch the progress messages

### 3. Done!
Your picture will show everywhere after the page reloads.

## What You'll See

**Button states:**
- "Uploading image..." â†’ Uploading to Cloudinary
- "Saving..." â†’ Saving to database
- Then redirects to your profile

**In browser console:**
```
Image uploaded successfully: https://res.cloudinary.com/dcm470yhl/...
Updating profile with data: { avatar: "https://..." }
```

## If It Doesn't Show
Clear cache: `http://localhost:3000/clear-profile-cache.html`

## That's It!
Your profile picture now:
- âœ… Uploads to Cloudinary
- âœ… Saves to database
- âœ… Shows in story bar
- âœ… Shows everywhere in app
- âœ… Persists after refresh

Test it now! ðŸš€
