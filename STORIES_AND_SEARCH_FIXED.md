# ✅ Stories and Search Fixed!

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. Stories API 500 Error ✅
**Problem:** Stories route was using PostgreSQL queries but app uses MongoDB

**Solution:** Rewrote stories route to use MongoDB directly
- ✅ Removed PostgreSQL StoryService dependency
- ✅ Added direct MongoDB queries
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Returns active, non-expired stories

### 2. Search Not Finding Users ✅
**Problem:** Search wasn't filtering inactive users properly

**Solution:** Updated search query to include active users
- ✅ Added `is_active` filter
- ✅ Searches username and full_name
- ✅ Case-insensitive search
- ✅ Returns up to 20 results

## 🎯 What's Working Now

### Stories
```typescript
GET /api/stories
```
- ✅ Returns all active stories
- ✅ Filters expired stories
- ✅ Includes user information
- ✅ Sorted by newest first
- ✅ No more 500 errors

### Search
```typescript
GET /api/search?q=username
```
- ✅ Searches users by username
- ✅ Searches users by full name
- ✅ Searches posts by caption
- ✅ Case-insensitive
- ✅ Returns active users only
