# âœ… FINAL SOLUTION - Profile Picture Working!

## What I Fixed

### Problem
- Profile edit page wasn't fetching current avatar from database
- Old avatar showing instead of latest from database
- JWT Manager not being used in profile edit

### Solution
Updated `app/profile/edit/page.tsx` to:
1. **Use JWT Manager** for all operations
2. **Fetch fresh avatar** from database on page load
3. **Show current avatar** as preview
4. **Upload new avatar** to Cloudinary
5. **Update database** with new URL
6. **Refresh JWT Manager cache** after save

## How It Works Now

### Step 1: Open Profile Edit
```
User goes to /profile/edit
  â†“
JWT Manager checks authentication
  â†“
JWT Manager fetches fresh data from database
  â†“
Current avatar loaded and displayed
```

### Step 2: Select New Picture
```
User clicks camera icon
  â†“
Selects new image file
  â†“
Preview shows new image
  â†“
Old avatar still in database (not changed yet)
```

### Step 3: Save Changes
```
User clicks "Save Changes"
  â†“
Upload new image to Cloudinary
  â†“
Get Cloudinary URL
  â†“
Save URL to database
  â†“
JWT Manager refreshes cache
  â†“
New avatar shows everywhere!
```

## Key Changes

### Before (Broken):
```typescript
// Used localStorage directly
let token = localStorage.getItem('token')

// Used user from auth context (might be old)
let avatarUrl = user?.avatar

// Manual token handling
```

### After (Fixed):
```typescript
// Uses JWT Manager
const token = JWTManager.getToken()

// Fetches fresh data from database
const currentUserData = await JWTManager.fetchUserData()
let avatarUrl = currentUserData?.avatar

// Refreshes cache after update
await JWTManager.refreshUserData()
```

## What You Get

## Test It Now
