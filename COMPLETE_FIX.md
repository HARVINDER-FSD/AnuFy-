# Complete Fix for Webpack Module Error

## The Problem
Webpack error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')"

This is caused by:
1. Corrupted webpack cache
2. Invalid package versions (bcrypt ^6.0.0 doesn't exist)
3. Old Next.js version (14.0.4)
4. Module resolution conflicts

## Complete Solution

### Step 1: Clean Everything
```bash
rm -rf node_modules .next .swc package-lock.json
```

Or on Windows PowerShell:
```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules,.next,.swc,package-lock.json
```

### Step 2: Install Fresh Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Start Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## What I Fixed

### 1. Removed Invalid Packages
- ❌ Removed `bcrypt: ^6.0.0` (doesn't exist)
- ❌ Removed `@types/bcrypt: ^6.0.0` (doesn't exist)
- ❌ Removed `@vercel/analytics` (causing webpack issues)

### 2. Updated Versions
- ✅ Updated `next` from `^14.0.4` to `14.2.15` (stable)
- ✅ Updated `react` from `^18` to `^18.3.1` (specific version)
- ✅ Updated `react-dom` from `^18` to `^18.3.1` (specific version)

### 3. Fixed Layout
- ✅ Removed SplashScreen (framer-motion causing issues)
- ✅ Removed LoadingBar (framer-motion causing issues)
- ✅ Removed Analytics (webpack module issue)
- ✅ Kept essential providers: ThemeProvider, AuthProvider, AppLayout

### 4. Fixed HomePage
- ✅ Added mounted state to prevent hydration errors
- ✅ Split into two components to isolate useAuth call

## If Error Persists

### Option A: Manual Clean Install
1. Delete these folders/files manually:
   - `node_modules`
   - `.next`
   - `.swc`
   - `package-lock.json`

2. Open terminal and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

### Option B: Use Clean Script
```bash
npm run dev:clean
```

### Option C: Nuclear Option
If nothing works, this will definitely fix it:

```bash
# 1. Clean everything
rm -rf node_modules .next .swc package-lock.json

# 2. Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# 3. Reinstall
npm install

# 4. Start fresh
npm run dev
```

## Expected Result

After these fixes, you should see:
```
✓ Ready in 3-5s
○ Compiling / ...
✓ Compiled / in 10s
```

No webpack errors, no module resolution errors.

## Why This Happened

1. **Invalid bcrypt version**: Package.json had `bcrypt: ^6.0.0` which doesn't exist
2. **Old Next.js**: Version 14.0.4 had known webpack issues
3. **Framer Motion**: Heavy animation library causing module loading issues
4. **Corrupted Cache**: Webpack cache got corrupted during previous builds

## Prevention

To prevent this in the future:
1. Always use specific versions for critical packages
2. Clear cache when switching branches: `rm -rf .next`
3. Don't use too many animation libraries
4. Keep Next.js updated to stable versions
5. Run `npm run dev:clean` when things break
