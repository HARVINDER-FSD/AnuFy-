# 🗑️ Clear All Notifications from Database

## 🎯 Why Clear Notifications?

The notifications in your database might have malformed data (missing user info, etc.) which is causing the fetch errors. Clearing them will give you a fresh start.

## 🚀 How to Clear All Notifications

### Option 1: Use the Web Page (EASIEST)

1. **Open this URL:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/clear-notifications.html
   ```

2. **Click "Clear All Notifications"** button

3. **Wait for confirmation** - Should say "✅ Success! Deleted X notifications"

4. **Automatically redirects** to notifications page

5. **Done!** All notifications deleted from database

---

### Option 2: Use API Directly

Open browser console (F12) and run:

```javascript
const token = document.cookie
    .split('; ')
    .find(row => row.startsWith('token=') || row.startsWith('client-token='))
    ?.split('=')[1];

fetch('/api/notifications/clear', {
    method: 'DELETE',
    headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    }
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => console.log('Deleted:', data.deletedCount, 'notifications'))
.catch(err => console.error('Error:', err));
```

## ✅ What Happens After Clearing

1. **All your notifications deleted** from database
2. **Badge shows 0** (no unread notifications)
3. **Notifications page empty** (clean slate)
4. **New notifications will work** properly when they come in

3. **Create a test notification:**

4. **New notification should appear** correctly!
