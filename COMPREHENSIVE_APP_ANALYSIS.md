## üöÄ **DEPLOYMENT READINESS**

**Recommendation:** 
- **Beta Launch:** Ready in 2-3 weeks (after Phase 1)

## üìù **FINAL ASSESSMENT**

### **Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Solid core features (posts, stories, reels)
- ‚úÖ Beautiful, modern UI
- ‚úÖ Real-time chat works well

### **Weaknesses:**

I recommend we focus on **Phase 1: Critical Features** first:

1. **Notifications System** (Most important!)

3. **Improved Search** (User experience)

Would you like me to start implementing any of these features? Which one should we tackle first?
