# ‚úÖ Story Bar Avatar Fix

## üêõ Problem
Your own story bar was not showing your profile picture correctly.

## üîß What Was Fixed

### 1. **Simplified Avatar Fetching Logic**
- Removed redundant console logs
- Streamlined the avatar fetching priority
- Fixed fallback chain to ensure avatar is always displayed

### 2. **Avatar Priority Order**
Now checks in this order:
1. `userAvatar` (from API fetch)
2. `myStories.avatar_url` (from your stories)
3. `user.avatar` (from auth context)
4. `user.avatar_url` (alternative field)
5. `user.profile_picture` (alternative field)
6. `/placeholder.svg` (fallback)

### 3. **Added Object-Cover Class**
- Ensures avatar images are properly cropped and centered
- Prevents distortion of profile pictures

### 4. **Debug Logging**
- Added development-only logging to help diagnose avatar issues
- Check browser console to see which avatar source is being used

## üß™ How to Test

1. **Clear your browser cache:**
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
   - Or visit: http://localhost:3001/cache-buster.html

2. **Check the feed page:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3001/feed
   - Look at the story bar at the top
   - Your profile picture should now appear in "Your story" or "Add story"

3. **Check browser console:**
   - Press F12 to open DevTools
   - Look for "StoriesBar Avatar Debug" logs
   - This will show which avatar source is being used

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If avatar still doesn't show:

1. **Check if you have a profile picture set:**
   - Go to Profile ‚Üí Edit Profile
   - Make sure you've uploaded an avatar

2. **Check the API response:**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Network tab
   - Look for `/api/users/me` request
   - Check if `avatar` or `avatar_url` field has a valid URL

3. **Check auth token:**
   - The avatar might be cached in your JWT token
   - Try logging out and logging back in
   - This will refresh your token with latest profile data

4. **Check database:**
   - Make sure your user document in MongoDB has `avatar_url` field
   - It should contain a valid Cloudinary URL or image path

## üìù Technical Details

### Files Modified:
- `components/stories/stories-bar.tsx`

### Changes Made:
1. Simplified `fetchUserAvatar` function
2. Fixed avatar priority logic
3. Added `object-cover` class to Avatar component
4. Added development debugging
5. Ensured fallback to placeholder.svg

## ‚úÖ Expected Behavior

**Before:**
- Story bar showed no avatar or placeholder
- Avatar might not update after profile changes

**After:**
- Story bar shows your current profile picture
- Avatar updates when you change your profile picture
- Proper fallback to placeholder if no avatar set
- Better error handling

## üéØ Next Steps

If the issue persists:
1. Check the browser console for debug logs
2. Verify your profile has an avatar in the database
3. Try logging out and back in to refresh the JWT token
4. Clear all browser cache and cookies
