# üéµ Spotify Integration - Final Setup

## ‚úÖ Current Status

Your app is running at: **http://localhost:3000**

## What You Have Now

### 1. Spotify Search API ‚úÖ
- **Status**: Working
- **Features**: Search 100M+ tracks
- **Preview**: 30-second clips
- **Login**: Not required

### 2. Web Playback SDK (Optional)
- **Status**: Ready to configure
- **Features**: Full songs (3-5 minutes)
- **Login**: Required (Spotify account)

## Quick Setup for Web Playback SDK

### Step 1: Add Redirect URI to Spotify

Go to: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard

1. Click your app
2. Click "Settings"
3. Find "Redirect URIs"
4. Add this **exact** URI:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/api/spotify/callback
   ```
5. Click "Add" then "Save"

**Important**: Spotify accepts `http://localhost` for development! No HTTPS needed locally.

### Step 2: Test It

Your environment is already configured:
```env
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=82101352a7cc4ce188358e7e3ec432f9
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=1788bd8c2748453e886d0d6433bec0f9
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=82101352a7cc4ce188358e7e3ec432f9
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Two Modes Available

### Mode 1: Preview Mode (Current - Working Now)
```
‚úÖ No login required
‚úÖ 30-second previews
‚úÖ Instant playback
‚úÖ Good for most use cases
```

**How to use:**
1. Search for music in your app
2. Select a song
3. Play 30-second preview immediately

### Mode 2: Full Song Mode (After Adding Redirect URI)
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Spotify login
‚úÖ Full songs (3-5 minutes)
‚úÖ High-quality streaming
‚úÖ Professional experience
```

**How to use:**
1. Search for music
2. Select a song
3. Click "Login with Spotify"
4. Authorize app
5. Play full song

## Important: HTTP vs HTTPS

### For Development (localhost)
- ‚úÖ **HTTP works**: `http://localhost:3000`
- ‚úÖ Spotify accepts HTTP for localhost
- ‚úÖ No SSL certificates needed
- ‚úÖ Easier to set up

### For Production (your domain)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **HTTPS required**: `https://yourdomain.com`
- ‚úÖ Vercel/Netlify provide HTTPS automatically
- ‚úÖ No extra configuration needed

## Spotify Dashboard Configuration

### Development
```
Redirect URI: http://localhost:3000/api/spotify/callback
```

### Production (when you deploy)
```
Redirect URI: https://yourdomain.com/api/spotify/callback
```

You can have both at the same time!
