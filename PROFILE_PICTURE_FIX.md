# Profile Picture Cache Fix Applied âœ…

## Problem
- Updated profile picture not showing in story bar
- Old profile picture showing everywhere in the app
- Browser caching old avatar images

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **API Server Updates** (`api-server/src/routes/users.ts`)
- Now updates both `avatar` and `avatar_url` fields in MongoDB
- Also updates `full_name` field for Atlas compatibility
- Returns both fields in response for consistency

### 2. **Profile Update Endpoint** (`app/api/users/profile/route.ts`)
- Added cache-busting timestamps to avatar URLs
- Ensures fresh images are loaded after updates

### 3. **Stories Bar Component** (`components/stories/stories-bar.tsx`)
- Always fetches fresh avatar from API (no cache)
- Adds cache-busting timestamps to avatar URLs
- Auto-refreshes avatar every 5 seconds to catch updates
- Prioritizes fresh API data over cached token data

### 4. **Auth Provider** (`components/auth/auth-provider.tsx`)
- Listens for profile update events
- Automatically refreshes user data after profile changes
- Fetches fresh data from API after updates

### 5. **Profile Edit Page** (`app/profile/edit/page.tsx`)
- Sends correct field names (`name` and `avatar` instead of `full_name` and `avatar_url`)
- Forces hard page reload after save to clear all caches
- Dispatches profile update event to refresh auth context

## How to See Your Updated Profile Picture

### Option 1: Use the Cache Clearer (Recommended)
1. Open: `http://localhost:3000/clear-profile-cache.html`
2. Click "Clear Cache & Reload"
3. You'll be redirected to your profile with fresh data

### Option 2: Manual Browser Cache Clear
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + Delete` (Mac)
2. Select "Cached images and files"
3. Click "Clear data"
4. Reload the page with `Ctrl + F5` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)

### Option 3: Hard Reload
1. Go to your profile page
2. Press `Ctrl + F5` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
3. This forces a fresh load without cache

## Testing the Fix

1. **Start both servers:**
   ```powershell
   # Terminal 1 - API Server
   cd api-server
   npm run dev

   # Terminal 2 - Next.js App
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Update your profile picture:**
   - Go to `/profile/edit`
   - Upload a new profile picture
   - Click "Save Changes"
   - Wait for the automatic redirect

3. **Verify the changes:**
   - Check your profile page
   - Check the story bar at the top
   - Check any posts or comments you've made

## Technical Details

### Cache Busting Strategy
- Avatar URLs now include timestamps: `avatar.jpg?t=1234567890`
- This forces browsers to fetch fresh images
- Timestamps are added automatically on every fetch

### Auto-Refresh Mechanism
- Stories bar refreshes avatar every 5 seconds
- Auth provider listens for profile update events
- Profile edit page triggers hard reload after save

### Database Field Mapping
- `avatar` â†’ `avatar_url` (MongoDB Atlas compatibility)
- `name` â†’ `full_name` (MongoDB Atlas compatibility)
- Both fields are updated simultaneously

## Why This Happened

1. **JWT Token Caching**: User data was loaded from JWT token which doesn't update automatically
2. **Browser Image Cache**: Browsers cache images aggressively for performance
3. **Field Name Mismatch**: API was updating `avatar` but Atlas uses `avatar_url`
4. **No Cache Busting**: Avatar URLs didn't have timestamps to force fresh loads

## Prevention

The fix includes:
- âœ… Automatic cache busting on all avatar URLs
- âœ… Auto-refresh mechanism in stories bar
- âœ… Event-based updates in auth provider
- âœ… Hard reload after profile updates
- âœ… Consistent field names across API and database

Your profile picture should now update instantly across the entire app! ðŸŽ‰
