# Profile Like & Mobile Responsive Fixes - Complete âœ…

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Like/Unlike Updates in Profile Page Posts
**Problem:** When users liked/unliked posts in the profile modal, the changes weren't reflected in the grid view.

**Solution:**
- Added `onLikeUpdate` callback prop to `InstagramPostModal` component
- Modified `ContentGrid` to maintain local state of items and update them when likes change
- The modal now notifies the parent component when a like/unlike action occurs
- The grid updates the like count and status in real-time without requiring a page refresh

**Files Modified:**
- `components/profile/instagram-post-modal.tsx` - Added callback to notify parent of like changes
- `components/profile/content-grid.tsx` - Added local state management and like update handler

### 2. âœ… Unlike Functionality Fixed
**Problem:** Unlike wasn't working properly - the API was using DELETE method instead of POST toggle.

**Solution:**
- Changed the like API to use POST method for both like and unlike (toggle behavior)
- The API now checks if a like exists and toggles accordingly
- Returns proper response with `liked` status, `likeCount`, and `likedBy` array

**Files Modified:**
- `components/profile/instagram-post-modal.tsx` - Changed to use POST method for toggle
- `app/api/posts/[postId]/like/route.ts` - Fixed toggle logic
- `app/api/reels/[reelId]/like/route.ts` - Fixed toggle logic

### 3. âœ… Notifications for Likes
**Problem:** No notifications were being created when users liked posts/reels.

**Solution:**
- Added notification creation in both post and reel like APIs
- Notifications are created when a user likes content (but not their own)
- Notifications are removed when a user unlikes content
- Notification includes: type, to_user_id, from_user_id, post_id/reel_id, read status, timestamp

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/posts/[postId]/like/route.ts` - Added notification creation/deletion
- `app/api/reels/[reelId]/like/route.ts` - Added notification creation/deletion

### 4. âœ… Post Card Mobile Responsive
**Problem:** Post cards had unwanted spacing on left/right sides and boundary lines on mobile.

**Solution:**
- Removed borders on mobile devices (border-0 on mobile, md:border on desktop)
- Removed rounded corners on mobile (rounded-none on mobile, md:rounded-lg on desktop)
- Removed shadow on mobile (shadow-none on mobile, md:shadow-sm on desktop)
- Posts now appear edge-to-edge on mobile like Instagram

**Files Modified:**
- `components/posts/post-card.tsx` - Updated Card className with responsive styles

## Technical Details

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "liked": true/false,
  "likeCount": 123,
  "likedBy": ["user1", "user2", "user3"]
}
```
