# 🔄 Restart Instructions

## Issue Fixed: Duplicate Next.js Config Files

**Problem**: You had two Next.js configuration files:
- `next.config.js` 
- `next.config.mjs`

This caused conflicts and the "link.js not found" error.

**Solution**: 
- ✅ Removed `next.config.js`
- ✅ Kept and updated `next.config.mjs` with all necessary settings
- ✅ Cleared `.next` cache folder

---

## 🚀 How to Restart

### Step 1: Stop the Current Server
If your dev server is running:
- Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal
- Wait for it to fully stop

### Step 2: Start Fresh
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Verify It Works
- Open browser to `http://localhost:3001`
- Navigate to `/messages`
- Check browser console for errors (should be none!)

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

1. **Removed duplicate config** - Only one `next.config.mjs` now
2. **Cleared cache** - Deleted `.next` folder
3. **Merged settings** - Combined best settings from both configs

---

## 🎯 Current Configuration

Your `next.config.mjs` now includes:

- ✅ **ESLint**: Ignores during builds
- ✅ **TypeScript**: Ignores build errors
- ✅ **Images**: Cloudinary support
- ✅ **MongoDB**: External package support
- ✅ **CORS**: API headers configured
- ✅ **File Size**: 50MB limit for uploads
