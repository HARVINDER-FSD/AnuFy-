# ðŸŽµ How to Integrate Full Song Playback

## Quick Integration Guide

You now have two music playback options:

### Option 1: Preview Mode (Current - 30s)
- No login required
- Quick and simple
- Good for testing

### Option 2: Full Song Mode (New - Complete songs)
- Requires Spotify login
- Professional experience
- Full 3-5 minute songs

## Integration in Your Music Flow

### Update `instagram-reels-music-flow.tsx`

Add this import at the top:

```typescript
import { SpotifyFullSongPlayer } from './spotify-full-song-player'
import { isSpotifyAuthenticated } from '@/lib/spotify-auth'
```

Add state for full song mode:

```typescript
const [showFullSongPlayer, setShowFullSongPlayer] = useState(false)
```

Add a button to switch to full song mode in the trim screen:

```typescript
{/* After the Done button */}
{selectedSong?.spotifyUri && (
  <button
    onClick={() => setShowFullSongPlayer(true)}
    className="px-4 py-2 bg-green-500 text-white font-semibold rounded-full"
  >
    ðŸŽµ Play Full Song
  </button>
)}
```

Add the full song player component:

```typescript
{/* At the end of the component, before closing div */}
{showFullSongPlayer && selectedSong && (
  <SpotifyFullSongPlayer
    song={selectedSong}
    trimStart={trimStart}
    trimEnd={trimEnd}
    onClose={() => setShowFullSongPlayer(false)}
    onTimeUpdate={(time) => setCurrentTime(time)}
  />
)}
```

## Complete Example

Here's a minimal example of how to use it:

```typescript
"use client"

import { useState } from 'react'
import { SpotifyFullSongPlayer } from '@/components/stories/spotify-full-song-player'

export function MusicExample() {
  const [showPlayer, setShowPlayer] = useState(false)
  
  const song = {
    id: 'spotify_track_id',
    title: 'Blinding Lights',
    artist: 'The Weeknd',
    duration: 202,
    durationFormatted: '3:22',
    artwork: 'https://...',
    previewUrl: 'https://...',
    spotifyUri: 'spotify:track:0VjIjW4GlUZAMYd2vXMi3b',
    source: 'spotify' as const
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setShowPlayer(true)}>
        Play Full Song
      </button>

      {showPlayer && (
        <SpotifyFullSongPlayer
          song={song}
          trimStart={0}
          trimEnd={30}
          onClose={() => setShowPlayer(false)}
        />
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## User Flow

### First Time User
```
1. User searches for music
2. Selects a song
3. Sees "Play Full Song" button
4. Clicks button
5. Prompted to login with Spotify
6. Authorizes app
7. Redirected back
8. Full song plays automatically
```

### Returning User
```
1. User searches for music
2. Selects a song
3. Clicks "Play Full Song"
4. Song plays immediately (already logged in)
```

## Automatic Token Handling

The system automatically:
- âœ… Checks if user is authenticated
- âœ… Refreshes expired tokens
- âœ… Handles errors gracefully
- âœ… Falls back to preview mode if needed
