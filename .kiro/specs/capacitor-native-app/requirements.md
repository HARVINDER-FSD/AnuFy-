# Capacitor Native App Conversion - Requirements

## Goal
Convert the existing Next.js web app into native iOS and Android apps using Capacitor, with native-level performance and instant loading.

## User Stories

### 1. Native App Build
**As a developer**, I want to build native iOS and Android apps from my web app
- Configure Capacitor for Next.js
- Set up iOS and Android projects
- Configure app metadata (name, bundle ID, version)
- Add app icons and splash screens

### 2. Native Features
**As a user**, I want access to native device features
- Camera access for photos/videos
- Push notifications
- File system access
- Share functionality
- Status bar customization
- Keyboard handling

### 3. Instant Loading
**As a user**, I want the app to load instantly like Instagram/TikTok
- Implement aggressive caching
- Add offline support
- Optimize bundle size
- Preload critical resources

### 4. Native Performance
**As a user**, I want smooth 60fps performance
- Hardware acceleration
- Native scrolling
- Optimized animations
- Memory management

## Technical Requirements

### Capacitor Plugins Needed
- @capacitor/camera
- @capacitor/push-notifications
- @capacitor/filesystem
- @capacitor/share
- @capacitor/status-bar
- @capacitor/keyboard
- @capacitor/splash-screen
- @capacitor/app
- @capacitor/haptics
- @capacitor/network

### Configuration Files
- capacitor.config.ts (enhanced)
- next.config.mjs (static export)
- package.json (add plugins)
- iOS configuration
- Android configuration

### Build Process
1. Build Next.js app (`npm run build`)
2. Sync with Capacitor (`npx cap sync`)
3. Open in IDE (`npx cap open ios/android`)
4. Build native app

## Acceptance Criteria

✅ Capacitor fully configured
✅ All native plugins installed
✅ App icons and splash screens added
✅ iOS project ready to build
✅ Android project ready to build
✅ Instant loading implemented
✅ Offline support working
✅ Native features accessible
✅ Complete build guide provided
✅ Performance optimized

## Out of Scope
- Actual building in Xcode/Android Studio (user must do)
- App Store submission
- Google Play submission
- Code signing setup

## Success Metrics
- App loads in <1 second
- Smooth 60fps scrolling
- Native features work correctly
- Build process takes <5 minutes
- App size <50MB
