# üîç Debug Profile Edit Page

## What I Added

### 1. Loading State
- Shows "Loading your profile..." while fetching data
- Prevents blank page during data load

### 2. Console Logs
Added detailed logging to track the data flow:
```
[Profile Edit] Starting to load user data...
[Profile Edit] Fetching fresh user data from JWT Manager...
[Profile Edit] Fresh user data received: {...}
[Profile Edit] Setting user data and form data
[Profile Edit] Setting avatar preview: https://...
[Profile Edit] Data loading complete
```

### 3. Error Handling
- Better error messages
- Loading state management
- Fallback handling

## How to Debug

### Step 1: Open Browser Console
1. Go to `/profile/edit`
2. Press `F12` to open DevTools
3. Go to "Console" tab

### Step 2: Check the Logs
You should see:
```
[Profile Edit] Starting to load user data...
[Profile Edit] Fetching fresh user data from JWT Manager...
[Profile Edit] Fresh user data received: {
  id: "...",
  username: "...",
  email: "...",
  avatar: "https://..." or "data:image/..."
  ...
}
[Profile Edit] Setting avatar preview: https://...
[Profile Edit] Data loading complete
```

### Step 3: Check What's Wrong

#### If you see "Not authenticated":
```
[Profile Edit] Not authenticated, redirecting to login
```
**Solution:** Log in again

#### If you see "No data returned":
```
[Profile Edit] No data returned from JWT Manager
```
**Solution:** Check if API server is running on port 8000

#### If you see avatar as base64:
```
[Profile Edit] Setting avatar preview: data:image/webp;base64,...
```
**Solution:** Use the fix tool at `/fix-my-avatar.html`

#### If you see Cloudinary URL:
```
[Profile Edit] Setting avatar preview: https://res.cloudinary.com/...
```
**Success!** ‚úÖ Your avatar is properly stored

## What to Look For

### Good Signs ‚úÖ
- Console shows all log messages
- Avatar preview loads
- Form fields are populated
- No errors in console

### Bad Signs ‚ùå
- No console logs appear
- "Error loading profile" toast
- Blank form fields
- Red errors in console

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: No Logs Appear
**Cause:** Page not loading or JavaScript error
**Solution:** Check for errors in console, refresh page

### Issue 2: "Could not load your profile data"
**Cause:** JWT Manager can't fetch from API
**Solution:** 
1. Check if API server is running
2. Check if you're logged in
3. Try logging out and back in

### Issue 3: Avatar Shows as base64
**Cause:** Old base64 data in database
**Solution:** Go to `/fix-my-avatar.html` and click "Fix My Avatar"

### Issue 4: Form Fields Empty
**Cause:** Data not being set properly
**Solution:** Check console logs to see what data was received

## Test Checklist
