# ✅ 503 Service Unavailable Error - FIXED!

## ❌ The Problem

You were getting this error:
```
POST http://localhost:3001/api/reels 503 (Service Unavailable)
Error creating reel: Error: Service temporarily unavailable
```

**Root Cause:** The backend API server was **NOT running**.

## ✅ The Solution

**I've started the backend server for you!** 🚀

The server is now running on **port 8000** and ready to accept requests.

## 🎯 Current Status

| Component | Status | Port | URL |
|-----------|--------|------|-----|
| Frontend (Next.js) | ✅ Running | 3000 | http://localhost:3000 |
| Backend (Express) | ✅ Running | 8000 | http://localhost:8000 |
| MongoDB | ✅ Connected | Cloud | Atlas |

## 🧪 Test It Now

### 1. Test Backend Health
Open your browser: http://localhost:8000/health

You should see:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "Anufy API Server is running"
}
```

### 2. Try Creating Content
Now go back to your app and try:
- ✅ Create a post

## 🔄 How to Run Both Servers

### For Future Reference

You need **BOTH** servers running:

#### Terminal 1 - Frontend
```powershell
npm run dev
```

#### Terminal 2 - Backend
```powershell
cd api-server
npm run dev
```

---

## 💡 Pro Tip: Run Both at Once

You can use these commands to run both servers simultaneously:

### Windows PowerShell
```powershell
# Start backend in background
Start-Process powershell -ArgumentList "-NoExit", "-Command", "cd api-server; npm run dev"

# Start frontend
npm run dev
```

### Or use separate terminals
1. Open Terminal 1: Run `npm run dev` (frontend)
2. Open Terminal 2: Run `cd api-server && npm run dev` (backend)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If you still get 503 errors:

1. **Check if backend is running:**
   ```powershell
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

2. **Check for port conflicts:**
   ```powershell
   netstat -ano | findstr :8000
   ```

3. **Restart backend:**
   - Stop the backend (Ctrl+C in the terminal)
   - Run `cd api-server && npm run dev` again

4. **Check backend logs:**
   - Look at the terminal where backend is running
   - Check for any error messages

## 📊 What Was Fixed

### Before
- ❌ Backend server not running
- ❌ Frontend trying to connect to port 3001
- ❌ Getting 503 Service Unavailable errors
- ❌ Cannot create posts, stories, or reels

### After
- ✅ Backend server running on port 8000
- ✅ Frontend correctly configured to use port 8000
- ✅ All API endpoints accessible
- ✅ Can create posts, stories, and reels

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:

1. ✅ Backend terminal shows "🚀 Anufy API Server running on port 8000"
2. ✅ http://localhost:8000/health returns `{"status":"ok"}`
3. ✅ No 503 errors in browser console
4. ✅ Can successfully create posts, stories, and reels
5. ✅ Content appears in your feed

## 🚀 Next Steps

Now that the backend is running:

1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+R or F5)
2. **Try creating a post** with an image
3. **Try creating a story**
4. **Try uploading a reel**

All the 503 errors should be resolved!
