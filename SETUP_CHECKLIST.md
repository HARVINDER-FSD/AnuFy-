## 🔐 Security Notes

Your Firebase credentials are in `.env`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyDB3JvWMThk_5EYmb4IWh54e60Ra_L2Dxc
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=application-ed096
```

**Important:**
- ✅ These are safe to expose (they're public)
- ✅ Security is handled by Firestore rules
- ✅ Only authenticated users can access chat
- ⚠️ Don't share your Firebase Admin SDK key (if you get one)
