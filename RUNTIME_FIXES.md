# Runtime Error Fixes Applied

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **Duplicate use-toast Module**
**Problem**: Two identical `use-toast.ts` files existed:
- `hooks/use-toast.ts` 
- `components/ui/use-toast.ts`

This caused webpack module resolution conflicts and "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')" errors.

**Solution**:
- Deleted `components/ui/use-toast.ts`
- Updated all imports to use `@/hooks/use-toast`
- Fixed in files:
  - `app/search/page.tsx`
  - `components/stories/create-story.tsx`
  - `components/post/post-comments.tsx`
  - `components/posts/CommentSection.tsx`

### 2. **Incorrect SplashScreen Usage**
**Problem**: `app/page.tsx` was importing and using SplashScreen with an `onComplete` prop that doesn't exist, while SplashScreen was already in the root layout.

**Solution**:
- Removed SplashScreen from `app/page.tsx`
- Simplified to just show loading spinner and redirect

### 3. **Hydration Mismatches**
**Problem**: Multiple components were causing SSR/client hydration mismatches:
- ThemeProvider checking theme during render
- SplashScreen checking sessionStorage during render
- Font loading with invalid onLoad attribute

**Solution**:
- Added `mounted` state to ThemeProvider
- Fixed SplashScreen to check sessionStorage only in useEffect
- Removed problematic font link attributes
- Properly using Inter font variable in body className

### 4. **Webpack Configuration Issues**
**Problem**: Custom webpack splitChunks configuration was creating circular dependencies and breaking module loading.

**Solution**:
- Removed all custom webpack optimization
- Removed optimizePackageImports experimental feature
- Removed webpack externals
- Let Next.js use its default optimized bundling

### 5. **Next.js Config Cleanup**
**Problem**: Too many experimental features and custom configurations causing conflicts.

**Solution**: Simplified to minimal config:
```javascript
experimental: {
  serverComponentsExternalPackages: ['mongodb', 'mongoose', 'bcryptjs', 'jsonwebtoken'],
}
```

## Files Modified

1. **next.config.mjs** - Removed problematic webpack config
2. **app/layout.tsx** - Fixed font usage and removed bad attributes
3. **app/page.tsx** - Removed duplicate SplashScreen
4. **components/theme-provider.tsx** - Added mounted state
5. **components/splash-screen.tsx** - Fixed sessionStorage check
6. **components/ui/use-toast.ts** - DELETED (duplicate)
7. **app/search/page.tsx** - Fixed import
8. **components/stories/create-story.tsx** - Fixed import
9. **components/post/post-comments.tsx** - Fixed import
10. **components/posts/CommentSection.tsx** - Fixed import

## Testing Checklist

After these fixes, test:
- [ ] App loads without webpack errors
- [ ] No hydration warnings in console
- [ ] Toast notifications work
- [ ] Theme switching works
- [ ] Splash screen shows once per session
- [ ] All pages load correctly
- [ ] Reels page doesn't get stuck
- [ ] Navigation works smoothly

## Performance Improvements Retained

Despite removing some optimizations, these remain:
- ✅ SWC minification
- ✅ Compression enabled
- ✅ Optimized images (AVIF/WebP)
- ✅ Performance headers
- ✅ Cache headers for static assets
- ✅ Faster splash screen (600ms)
- ✅ Faster loading bar (300ms)
- ✅ Service worker (production only)
- ✅ Middleware caching

## Root Cause

The main issue was **module duplication** and **over-optimization**. The duplicate `use-toast` file caused webpack to create conflicting module references, leading to the "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')" error. Combined with aggressive webpack chunking, this created a cascade of module resolution failures.

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues:
1. Never duplicate files with same exports
2. Use TypeScript path aliases consistently
3. Don't over-optimize webpack - trust Next.js defaults
4. Always check for hydration mismatches
5. Test after each optimization change
