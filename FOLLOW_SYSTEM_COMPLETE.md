# ✅ Complete Follow System with Private Accounts

I've implemented a full Instagram-style follow system with public/private accounts, follow requests, and notifications!

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Public Accounts (Default)**
```
User A clicks "Follow" on User B's profile
    ↓
Follow relationship created instantly
    ↓
User B gets notification: "@userA started following you"
    ↓
Button changes to "Following"
    ↓
User A sees User B's content in feed
```

### **Private Accounts**
```
User A clicks "Follow" on User B's private profile
    ↓
Follow REQUEST created (not follow)
    ↓
Button changes to "Requested"
    ↓
User B gets notification: "@userA requested to follow you"
    ↓
User B can Accept or Reject
    ↓
If ACCEPTED:
  - Follow relationship created
  - User A gets notification: "@userB accepted your follow request"
  - Button changes to "Following"
  - User A can now see User B's content
    ↓
If REJECTED:
  - Request deleted silently
  - No notification sent to User A
  - Button returns to "Follow"
```
