# ‚úÖ Story Looping Implemented

## How It Works Now

Stories now loop continuously through all users, just like Instagram!

### Story Flow:

```
User 1 Story 1 ‚Üí User 1 Story 2 ‚Üí User 1 Story 3
                                        ‚Üì
User 2 Story 1 ‚Üê User 2 Story 2 ‚Üê User 2 Story 3
        ‚Üì
User 3 Story 1 ‚Üí User 3 Story 2 ‚Üí User 3 Story 3
                                        ‚Üì
                                   CLOSE & Return to Feed
```

## Navigation Behavior

### Tap Right / Swipe Left (Next):
1. Shows next story of **same user**
2. When user's stories finish ‚Üí Automatically moves to **next user's first story**
3. When ALL stories finish ‚Üí **Closes viewer and returns to feed**

### Tap Left / Swipe Right (Previous):
1. Shows previous story of **same user**
2. At first story of user ‚Üí Goes to **previous user's last story**
3. At very first story ‚Üí Stays there (can't go back further)

### Close Button (X):
- Closes viewer immediately
- Returns to feed

## Technical Implementation

### State Management:
- `currentUserIndex` - Tracks which user's stories we're viewing
- `currentStoryIndex` - Tracks which story within that user's group
- `groupedStories` - Stories organized by user

### Smart Navigation:
```javascript
// Next story logic:
if (more stories in current user) {
  ‚Üí Show next story
} else if (more users) {
  ‚Üí Move to next user's first story
} else {
  ‚Üí Close and return to feed
}

// Previous story logic:
if (not first story of user) {
  ‚Üí Show previous story
} else if (not first user) {
  ‚Üí Move to previous user's last story
} else {
  ‚Üí Stay at first story
}
```

## User Experience

### Seamless Flow:
