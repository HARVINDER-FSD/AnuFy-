# Like Feature - Final Status

## ✅ What's Working

1. **Database Connection**: MongoDB Atlas is connected and working
2. **Like API**: Successfully saves likes to database
3. **Unlike API**: Successfully removes likes from database
4. **Feed API**: Correctly fetches like status on page load
5. **Double-click Prevention**: Button is disabled for 5 seconds after clicking

## ❌ Current Issue

**You are clicking the like button twice**, which causes:
1. First click → Likes the post (saved to database)
2. Second click (3-4 seconds later) → Unlikes the post (removed from database)
3. Page refresh → Shows no like (because it was unliked)

## 📊 Evidence from Logs

```
[Like API REQUEST [34tshm] at 13:48:16] - Liked post, count: 1
[Like API REQUEST [rgms17] at 13:48:19] - Unliked post, count: 0
```

Two requests, 3 seconds apart = double-click

## ✅ Solution

**BE VERY CAREFUL TO CLICK ONLY ONCE:**

1. Click the heart icon **ONE TIME**
2. **Wait 10 seconds** without touching anything
3. The button will be grayed out for 5 seconds
4. After 10 seconds, refresh the page
5. The like should persist

## 🔍 How to Test Properly

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Filter by "like"
4. Click the heart icon ONCE
5. Watch the Network tab - you should see **ONLY ONE** request
6. If you see TWO requests, you clicked twice

## 💡 Tips

- Don't click rapidly
- Wait for the button to re-enable before clicking again
- The button is intentionally disabled for 5 seconds to prevent double-clicks
- If you're on mobile, make sure you're not accidentally double-tapping

## 🎯 The Code is Correct

All the fixes have been applied:
- ✅ Global lock prevents multiple simultaneous requests
- ✅ Button is disabled after clicking
- ✅ MongoDB Atlas connection is working
- ✅ Feed API returns correct like status
- ✅ Like API verifies writes to database

The only issue is user behavior (double-clicking).
