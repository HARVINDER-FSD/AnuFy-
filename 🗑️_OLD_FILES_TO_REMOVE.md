## ⚠️ Read This First

These files are from the old architecture and can be safely removed **after you've tested** that everything works with the new architecture.

## 🧹 Cleanup Commands

### Remove Old Master Folder
```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
Remove-Item -Path master -Recurse -Force
Write-Host "Old master folder removed!" -ForegroundColor Green
```

```bash
# Linux/Mac
rm -rf master
echo "Old master folder removed!"
```

### Remove Old Documentation Files
```powershell
# Remove old master-related documentation
Remove-Item -Path "MASTER_*.md" -Force
Remove-Item -Path "START_HERE_MASTER_SYSTEM.md" -Force
Write-Host "Old documentation removed!" -ForegroundColor Green
```

## ⚠️ Before Removing - Checklist

- [ ] Test your application thoroughly
- [ ] Verify no imports from `@/master`
- [ ] Check all features work
- [ ] Backup if you want to be safe
- [ ] Run `npm run build` successfully

## 🔍 Verify No Imports

Run this command to check for any remaining imports:

```powershell
# Check for imports from old master folder
Get-ChildItem -Path . -Include *.ts,*.tsx,*.js,*.jsx -Recurse | 
  Select-String -Pattern "from ['\""]@/master" | 
  Select-Object -Property Path, LineNumber, Line
```

If this returns nothing, you're safe to remove!

## 📊 What's Being Replaced

| Old File | New Location | Status |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| `master/api.ts` | `src/services/api/ApiClient.ts` | ✅ Replaced |
| `master/auth.ts` | `src/services/auth/AuthService.ts` | ✅ Replaced |
| `master/cache.ts` | `src/services/cache/CacheService.ts` | ✅ Replaced |
| `master/config.ts` | `src/core/config/index.ts` | ✅ Replaced |

| `master/theme.ts` | `src/services/theme/ThemeService.ts` | ✅ Replaced |
| `master/index.ts` | `src/sdk/index.ts` | ✅ Replaced |

## 🎯 After Removal

Once you remove the old files:

1. **Verify build**: `npm run build`
2. **Test app**: `npm run dev`
3. **Check features**: Test all functionality
4. **Commit changes**: Git commit the cleanup

## 💡 Gradual Approach

If you're not ready to remove everything:

1. **Keep for now**: Leave old files as backup
2. **Test thoroughly**: Use the app for a few days
3. **Remove later**: Delete when you're confident

## 🚀 New Architecture Benefits

After removing old files, you'll have:

✅ Cleaner codebase
✅ Better organization
✅ Type-safe code
✅ Production-ready architecture
✅ Easier maintenance

## 📞 If Something Breaks

If you remove files and something breaks:

1. **Restore from git**: `git checkout master/`
2. **Check imports**: Look for any missed imports
3. **Review migration guide**: Check MIGRATION_TO_NEW_ARCHITECTURE.md

## ✅ Safe Removal Script

Create a backup before removing:

```powershell
# Create backup
Copy-Item -Path master -Destination master_backup -Recurse
Write-Host "Backup created: master_backup/" -ForegroundColor Green

# Test build
npm run build

# If successful, remove old folder
if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
    Remove-Item -Path master -Recurse -Force
    Write-Host "Old master folder removed successfully!" -ForegroundColor Green
} else {
    Write-Host "Build failed! Keeping old files." -ForegroundColor Red
}
```

**Remember:** Only remove after testing! The new architecture is ready, but safety first! 🛡️
