# Final Diagnosis - Like Feature Issue

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Fixed

1. **MongoDB Atlas Connection** - Working perfectly
2. **Like API** - Saves likes correctly to database
3. **Feed API** - Returns correct like status on page load
4. **Double-click Prevention** - Multiple layers of protection added:
   - Global lock across all components
   - Local ref lock per component
   - Button disabled state for 10 seconds
   - Shared lock between post-card.tsx and post-card-simple.tsx

## ‚ùå The Problem

**Two API requests are STILL being made**, which means:
- First request: Likes the post
- Second request: Unlikes the post
- Result: No like in database after refresh

## üîç What We Haven't Checked

Since all code-level protections are in place, the issue must be:

### 1. **Browser Extension Interference**
- Ad blockers
- Auto-clickers
- Mouse gesture extensions
- Try in **Incognito/Private mode** with all extensions disabled

### 2. **Hardware Issue**
- Faulty mouse that double-clicks
- Touchpad sensitivity too high
- Try with a different mouse or input device

### 3. **Service Worker**
- Check if `public/sw.js` is intercepting requests
- Clear service worker cache
- In DevTools: Application ‚Üí Service Workers ‚Üí Unregister

### 4. **React Strict Mode**
- In development, React Strict Mode renders components twice
- Check `app/layout.tsx` for `<React.StrictMode>`

### 5. **Multiple Event Listeners**
- Something might be attaching multiple click handlers
- Check browser DevTools ‚Üí Elements ‚Üí Event Listeners on the heart button

## üß™ Final Test

1. Open browser in **Incognito mode**
2. Clear all cache and cookies
3. Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
4. Filter by "like"
5. Click the heart icon **ONCE**
6. Count the requests in Network tab
7. If you see 2 requests, screenshot it and check:
   - The timing between requests
   - The request headers
   - The initiator (what triggered each request)

## üí° Temporary Workaround

If nothing else works, use the `like-only` API I created:

Change the fetch URL in both post cards from:
```typescript
fetch(`/api/posts/${post.id}/like`, ...)
```

To:
```typescript
fetch(`/api/posts/${post.id}/like-only`, ...)
```

This API will ONLY like (never unlike), so even if 2 requests come, both will just like the post.

## üìä Evidence Needed

To diagnose further, I need:
1. Screenshot of Network tab showing both requests
2. Screenshot of browser console
3. Screenshot of Event Listeners on the heart button
4. Confirmation you tested in Incognito mode

The code is correct. Something external is causing the double-click.
