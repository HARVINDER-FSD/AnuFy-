# MongoDB Connection & Search Fixed ✅

## Issues Resolved

### 1. MongoDB Connection Timeouts
- **Problem**: Intermittent `querySrv ETIMEOUT` errors
- **Solution**: 
  - Improved connection pooling (50 max, 5 min pool size)
  - Added connection health checks
  - Implemented automatic reconnection on stale connections
  - Reduced timeout from 30s to 10s for faster failure detection

### 2. Trending Endpoint Missing
- **Problem**: `/api/explore/trending` returned 500 errors
- **Solution**: Implemented MongoDB aggregation pipeline to fetch trending posts based on:
  - Recent posts (last 7 days)
  - Engagement score (likes × 2 + comments)
  - Sorted by engagement and recency

### 3. Search Not Working
- **Problem**: Search endpoint timing out
- **Solution**: 
  - Connected Mongoose properly in `connectToDatabase()`
  - Both MongoDB native driver and Mongoose now work together
  - Search now finds users by username and full name

## Testing

### Test Trending
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/explore/trending?category=all&limit=20"
```

### Test Search
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/search?q=harvinder"
```

### Test MongoDB Connection
```bash
node scripts/test-mongodb-connection.js
```

## What Changed

### Files Modified:
1. `lib/mongodb.ts` - Better connection pooling
2. `api-server/src/lib/database.ts` - Added Mongoose connection + health checks
3. `api-server/src/routes/explore.ts` - Implemented trending with MongoDB aggregation
4. `scripts/test-mongodb-connection.js` - New diagnostic script

## Status
✅ MongoDB Atlas connected successfully
✅ Search working (finds users)
✅ Trending endpoint working (returns posts by engagement)
✅ Connection pooling optimized
✅ Auto-reconnection on failures

## Next Steps
Your app should now:
- Load trending content on explore page
- Search users successfully
- Handle connection issues gracefully with retries
