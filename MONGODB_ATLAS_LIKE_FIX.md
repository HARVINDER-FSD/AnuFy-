# MongoDB Atlas Like Persistence - FIXED ‚úÖ

## The Real Problem

You were using **test posts with fake IDs** (`test-1`, `test-2`, `test-3`) that don't exist in your MongoDB Atlas database!

### What Was Happening:

1. **Profile page loaded** ‚Üí Added test posts with IDs: `test-1`, `test-2`, `test-3`
2. **You liked a test post** ‚Üí API saved like with post_id: `test-1` to MongoDB Atlas
3. **You refreshed** ‚Üí API fetched real posts from MongoDB Atlas (which don't include `test-1`)
4. **Like disappeared** ‚Üí Because the test post IDs don't match any real post IDs in the database

### The Test Posts Code (REMOVED):
```typescript
const testPosts = [
  {
    id: 'test-1',  // ‚ùå This ID doesn't exist in MongoDB!
    caption: 'Test post 1 - Click me to open!',
    image: 'https://picsum.photos/400/400?random=1',
    // ...
  },
  // More test posts...
]
setPosts(testPosts)  // ‚ùå This overwrote real posts from API!
```

## The Fix

**Removed all test data** from the profile page:
- ‚ùå Removed test posts
- ‚ùå Removed test reels  
- ‚ùå Removed test saved items
- ‚ùå Removed test tagged items

Now the profile page **only shows real data from MongoDB Atlas**.

## How to Use Your Profile Now

### Step 1: Create Real Posts
Since test posts are removed, you need to create real posts:

1. Go to `/create/post` or click the "+" button
2. Upload an image
3. Add a caption
4. Click "Post"

This will create a real post in MongoDB Atlas with a proper ObjectId.

### Step 2: Like Your Posts
1. Go to your profile page
2. Click on a post (now a real post from the database)
3. Click the heart icon to like it
4. The like is saved to MongoDB Atlas with the correct post ID

### Step 3: Refresh and Verify
1. Press F5 to refresh the page
2. The post should still show as liked ‚úÖ
3. The like count should be correct ‚úÖ

## Why This Works Now

### Before (With Test Posts):
```
Like API: Saves like with post_id = "test-1"
         ‚Üì
MongoDB Atlas: { post_id: "test-1", user_id: "..." }
         ‚Üì
Refresh ‚Üí Fetch Posts API: Returns posts with IDs like "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011"
         ‚Üì
Check if "test-1" is in liked posts ‚Üí ‚ùå NOT FOUND
         ‚Üì
Post shows as unliked
```

### After (With Real Posts):
```
Like API: Saves like with post_id = "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011"
         ‚Üì
MongoDB Atlas: { post_id: ObjectId("507f1f77bcf86cd799439011"), user_id: "..." }
         ‚Üì
Refresh ‚Üí Fetch Posts API: Returns posts with ID "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011"
         ‚Üì
Check if "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011" is in liked posts ‚Üí ‚úÖ FOUND
         ‚Üì
Post shows as liked with correct count
```

## MongoDB Atlas Collections

Your database now properly uses these collections:

### posts
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId("507f1f77bcf86cd799439011"),
  user_id: ObjectId("..."),
  caption: "My real post",
  media_urls: ["https://..."],
  likes_count: 1,
  created_at: ISODate("2024-...")
}
```

### likes
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId("..."),
  post_id: ObjectId("507f1f77bcf86cd799439011"),  // Matches the post!
  user_id: ObjectId("..."),
  created_at: ISODate("2024-...")
}
```

### notifications
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId("..."),
  type: "like",
  to_user_id: ObjectId("..."),
  from_user_id: ObjectId("..."),
  post_id: ObjectId("507f1f77bcf86cd799439011"),
  read: false,
  created_at: ISODate("2024-...")
}
```

## Viewing Your Data in MongoDB Atlas

1. Go to [cloud.mongodb.com](https://cloud.mongodb.com)
2. Login with your credentials

### Test 3: Multiple Posts
1. ‚úÖ Create 3 posts
2. ‚úÖ Like 2 of them
3. ‚úÖ Refresh page
4. ‚úÖ Only the 2 liked posts show red hearts

## Console Logs to Verify

After the fix, you should see these logs:

**When page loads:**
```
Fetching posts for user: 507f...
Current user ID: 507f...
Found posts: 3
[User Posts API] Found likes: 2
[User Posts API] User has liked 2 posts: ["507f...", "507f..."]
[User Posts API] Post 507f...: is_liked=true, likes_count=1
[User Posts API] Post 507f...: is_liked=true, likes_count=1
[User Posts API] Post 507f...: is_liked=false, likes_count=0
```

**When you like a post:**
```
[Modal] Like clicked - current state: { isLiked: false, likesCount: 0, itemId: "507f..." }
[Like API] Inserting like: { post_id: ObjectId("507f..."), user_id: ObjectId("507f...") }
[Like API] Like inserted with ID: 507f...
[Like API] Success - liked: true count: 1
```

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Real Data** - All posts come from MongoDB Atlas
‚úÖ **Persistent Likes** - Likes survive page refreshes
‚úÖ **Correct IDs** - Post IDs match between like and fetch operations
‚úÖ **Notifications Work** - Notifications are created with correct post IDs
‚úÖ **Production Ready** - No test data in production

## Next Steps

1. **Create some posts** using the create post page
2. **Test liking** your real posts
3. **Verify persistence** by refreshing the page
4. **Check MongoDB Atlas** to see your data

The like persistence issue is now completely fixed! üéâ
