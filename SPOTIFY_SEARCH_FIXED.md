# üéµ Spotify Search Fixed!

## What Was Wrong

Spotify was filtering out tracks without `preview_url`, which caused 0 results. Many popular songs don't have preview URLs available in certain regions.

## What I Fixed

1. **Added market parameter** - `market=US` to get better preview availability
2. **Increased limit** - From 20 to 50 tracks, then filter to best 20
3. **Removed strict filter** - Now includes all tracks, prioritizes ones with previews
4. **Better logging** - Shows how many tracks have previews vs don't

## How It Works Now

```
Search "Blinding Lights"
    ‚Üì
Spotify returns 50 tracks
    ‚Üì
Separate into:
- Tracks WITH preview URLs (playable)
- Tracks WITHOUT preview URLs (metadata only)
    ‚Üì
Return top 20 (preview tracks first)
```

## Test It Now

1. **Restart your dev server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Search for music** in your story/reel creator

3. **Check console logs** - You should now see:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Spotify: 20 total songs (15 with preview)
   ```

## What You'll See

### Songs with Preview URLs
- ‚úÖ Can be played (30-second preview)
- ‚úÖ Full metadata (title, artist, artwork)
- ‚úÖ Ready to use in stories/reels

### Songs without Preview URLs
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Metadata only (title, artist, artwork)
- ‚ùå Can't be played (no audio)
- üí° Still useful for display/selection

## Why Some Songs Don't Have Previews

Spotify preview availability depends on:
- **Region** - Some tracks restricted by country
- **Rights** - Artist/label restrictions
- **Age** - Older tracks may not have previews
- **Type** - Some content types don't support previews

## Your Component Should Handle This

Make sure your music player component checks for `previewUrl`:

```typescript
{song.previewUrl ? (
  <audio src={song.previewUrl} />
) : (
  <p>Preview not available</p>
)}
```

## Console Output Examples

### Good Results
```
‚úÖ Spotify token obtained
Spotify: 18 with preview, 2 without
‚úÖ Spotify: 20 total songs (18 with preview)
```

### Fallback to iTunes
```
Spotify search failed, falling back to iTunes:
iTunes: 20 songs with previews
```

## Testing Different Queries

Try these searches to test:

1. **Popular songs** - "Blinding Lights", "Shape of You"
   - Should have many previews

2. **Older songs** - "Bohemian Rhapsody", "Hotel California"
   - May have fewer previews

3. **New releases** - Search current chart toppers
   - Usually have previews

4. **Indie/Underground** - Lesser-known artists
   - Preview availability varies

## If Still Getting 0 Results

1. **Check credentials** in `.env`:
   ```env
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=82101352a7cc4ce188358e7e3ec432f9
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=1788bd8c2748453e886d0d6433bec0f9
   ```

2. **Verify token is obtained** - Look for:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Spotify token obtained
   ```

3. **Check for errors** in console:
   ```
   Spotify token error: 401
   Spotify search failed: 403
   ```

4. **Test API directly**:
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:3000/api/music/search?q=test"
   ```

## Fallback to iTunes

If Spotify fails for any reason, the API automatically falls back to iTunes:
- ‚úÖ No credentials needed
- ‚úÖ Always has preview URLs
- ‚úÖ Good for testing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Smaller catalog than Spotify

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Restart server
2. ‚úÖ Test search functionality
3. ‚úÖ Verify songs appear
4. ‚úÖ Check which have previews
5. üéµ Use in your stories/reels!

---

**The search should now work!** You'll get results even if some songs don't have preview URLs. Songs with previews will be prioritized at the top of the results.
