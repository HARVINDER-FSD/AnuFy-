# ✅ Music Preview URL Fix

## Problem Found

**Preview URL was null!**

```
Preview URL: null
Attempting to play: null
```

## Root Cause

Spotify (and other APIs) don't provide preview URLs for ALL songs due to:
- Licensing restrictions
- Regional availability
- Artist/label preferences
- New releases

## Solution Applied

### 1. Filter Songs Without Previews

Updated API to **only return songs that have preview URLs**:

```typescript
// Before (returned songs with null previews)
const songs = data.tracks.items.map(track => ({
  previewUrl: track.preview_url  // Could be null!
}))

// After (filters out null previews)
const songs = data.tracks.items
  .filter(track => track.preview_url)  // ← Only songs with previews
  .map(track => ({
    previewUrl: track.preview_url  // ← Always has value
  }))
```

### 2. Added Logging

API now logs:
- Which songs don't have previews
- How many songs were returned with previews

## What Changed

✅ **Spotify API** - Filters out tracks without `preview_url`
✅ **Deezer API** - Filters out tracks without `preview` field  
✅ **iTunes API** - Filters out tracks without `previewUrl`

## Testing

### 1. Restart Server

```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### 2. Check Server Console

When you search, you'll see:

```
No preview for: Song Name by Artist
No preview for: Another Song by Artist
Spotify returned 15 songs with previews
```

### 3. Try Searching

Search for popular songs - they usually have previews:
- "Blinding Lights"
- "Shape of You"
- "Levitating"
- "As It Was"

### 4. Click Play

Now when you click a song and press play, it should work! 🎵

## Why Some Songs Don't Have Previews

### Spotify
- New releases (first few weeks)
- Exclusive content
- Regional restrictions
- Artist opt-out

### Typical Availability
- ✅ 70-80% of songs have previews
- ❌ 20-30% don't (filtered out now)

## User Experience

### Before
```
Search: "New Song"
Results: 20 songs
Click song → Preview URL: null → No audio 😞
```

### After
```
Search: "New Song"  
Results: 15 songs (only ones with previews)
Click song → Preview URL: https://... → Audio plays! 🎵
```

## If Still No Results

If you search and get 0 results:
1. Try a different, more popular song
2. Check server console for errors
3. Verify Spotify credentials are correct

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Restart server
2. ✅ Search for "Blinding Lights"
3. ✅ Should see results with preview URLs
4. ✅ Click play - music should work!
