## How It Works Now

### 1. Login Flow
```
User logs in
  â†“
JWT token created (for auth only)
  â†“
JWT Manager stores token
  â†“
JWT Manager fetches user data from database
  â†“
User sees latest avatar/name/bio
```

### 2. Profile Update Flow
```
User uploads new picture
  â†“
Upload to Cloudinary
  â†“
Get Cloudinary URL
  â†“
Save URL to database
  â†“
Dispatch 'profile-updated' event
  â†“
JWT Manager refreshes data
  â†“
User sees new picture everywhere
```

### 3. Page Load Flow
```
Page loads
  â†“
JWT Manager checks if authenticated
  â†“
JWT Manager fetches from database
  â†“
User sees latest data
```

## Test Checklist

### Test 1: Profile Picture Update
