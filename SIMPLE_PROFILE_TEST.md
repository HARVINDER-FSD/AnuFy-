# Simple Profile Test

## You're not seeing anything on the profile page. Let's fix this step by step.

### Step 1: Check if profile page loads at all

**Open browser console (F12) and look for:**
- Any RED errors?
- What errors do you see?

### Step 2: Try accessing profile

Go to: `http://localhost:3000/profile`

**Do you see:**
- Your username and avatar? (Yes/No)
- The tabs (Posts, Reels, Saved, Tagged)? (Yes/No)
- Anything at all? (Yes/No)

### Step 3: Check if you're logged in

The profile page requires login. 

**Are you logged in?**
- If NO → Go to `/login` first
- If YES → Continue

### Step 4: Simple test

Let me create a super simple test page that will definitely work.

**Tell me:**
1. Do you see your profile header (avatar, username)?
2. Do you see the 4 tabs?
3. What do you see under the Posts tab?
4. Any errors in console (F12)?

This will help me understand what's broken!
