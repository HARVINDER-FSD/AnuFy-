## What Should I Implement First?

**Option A: Quick Fixes (30 min total)**
1. Panel toggle & close on tap outside
2. Music without template option
3. Better icons

**Option B: Full Redesign (2-3 hours)**
1. Everything from Option A
2. Complete sticker tray redesign
3. All icon upgrades
4. Polish all interactions

**Option C: Just the Essentials (15 min)**
1. Panel toggle only
2. Music without template
3. Done!

## My Recommendation:

Start with **Option A (Quick Fixes)** because:
- Biggest impact for time invested
- Fixes main UX issues
- Makes app feel polished
- Can do full redesign later

Then if you want, we can do the full sticker tray redesign separately.

**What would you like me to do first?**
1. Panel toggle + close on outside tap?
2. Music without template option?
3. Better icons?
4. All of the above?

Let me know and I'll implement it right away!
