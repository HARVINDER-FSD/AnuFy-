# 🎵 Spotify Full Song Playback - Complete Setup Guide

## What This Gives You

Instead of 30-second previews, users can now play **complete songs** (3-5 minutes) directly in your app using Spotify's Web Playback SDK.

### Features
- ✅ **Full-length songs** - Complete tracks, not previews
- ✅ **100M+ catalog** - Entire Spotify library
- ✅ **High-quality streaming** - Direct from Spotify servers
- ✅ **Free accounts supported** - Works with free Spotify users
- ✅ **In-browser playback** - No external app needed
- ✅ **Trim & loop** - Select any portion of the song

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Configure Spotify App

1. **Go to Spotify Developer Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
   - Login with your Spotify account

2. **Create a New App**
   - Click "Create app"
   - App name: `Anufy Music`
   - App description: `Full song playback for stories and reels`
   - Website: `http://localhost:3000` (or your domain)
   - **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost:3000/api/spotify/callback` ⚠️ IMPORTANT!
   - Check "Web Playback SDK" in APIs used
   - Accept terms and click "Save"

3. **Get Your Credentials**
   - Click "Settings" in your app
   - Copy **Client ID**
   - Click "View client secret" and copy **Client Secret**

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
# Spotify Full Song Playback
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Important Notes:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` must be the same as `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`
- For production, change `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to your domain
- Never commit `.env` to git (already in `.gitignore`)

### Step 3: Restart Your Server

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test the Integration

1. **Create a Story/Reel**
   - Go to story creator
   - Click "Add Music"

2. **Search for a Song**
   - Search: "Blinding Lights"
   - Select any song

3. **Login to Spotify**
   - Click "Login with Spotify"
   - Authorize the app
   - You'll be redirected back

4. **Play Full Song**
   - Song will play in full (not just 30s)
   - Trim any portion you want
   - Loop within your selection

## 🎯 How It Works

### Architecture

```
User Flow:
1. Search music → Spotify API (search)
2. Select song → Prompt for login
3. Login → Spotify OAuth
4. Play → Web Playback SDK (full song)
```

### Two Modes

#### Preview Mode (Default)
- No login required
- 30-second previews
- Uses iTunes/Spotify preview URLs
- Good for quick testing

#### Full Song Mode (With Login)
- Requires Spotify login
- Complete songs (3-5 minutes)
- Uses Web Playback SDK
- Professional experience

### Authentication Flow

```
1. User clicks "Login with Spotify"
   ↓
2. Redirects to Spotify authorization
   ↓
3. User approves permissions
   ↓
4. Redirects to /api/spotify/callback
   ↓
5. Exchanges code for tokens
   ↓
6. Stores tokens in localStorage
   ↓
7. Initializes Web Playback SDK
   ↓
8. Ready to play full songs!
```

## 📁 Files Created

### Authentication
- ✅ `lib/spotify-auth.ts` - OAuth flow & token management
- ✅ `app/api/spotify/callback/route.ts` - OAuth callback handler

### Playback
- ✅ `lib/spotify-player.ts` - Web Playback SDK wrapper
- ✅ `components/stories/spotify-full-song-player.tsx` - Full song player UI

### Search (Updated)
- ✅ `app/api/music/search/route.ts` - Now uses Spotify API

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

### What We Store
- Access token (expires in 1 hour)

### Permissions Required
- `streaming` - Play music
- `user-read-email` - User identification
- `user-read-private` - Basic profile
- `user-read-playback-state` - Current playback info
- `user-modify-playback-state` - Control playback

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Login with Spotify" button doesn't work
- Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` is set
- Verify it matches `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`
- Restart dev server

### "Redirect URI mismatch" error
- Go to Spotify Dashboard → Your App → Settings
- Add: `http://localhost:3000/api/spotify/callback`
- Must match exactly (including http/https)

### "Player not ready" message
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure Spotify account is active
- Try refreshing the page

### Songs still play 30s previews
- User must login with Spotify
- Check if "Login with Spotify" button appears
- Verify tokens are stored (check localStorage)

### "Authentication error" in console
- Tokens may be expired
- Clear localStorage and login again
- Check `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` is correct

## 📱 Production Deployment

### Vercel/Production Setup

1. **Update Redirect URI in Spotify Dashboard**
   ```
   https://yourdomain.com/api/spotify/callback
   ```

2. **Add Environment Variables**
   ```
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
   ```

3. **Redeploy**
   ```bash
   git push
   # Vercel auto-deploys
   ```
