# üìç WHERE IS THE EXPLORE PAGE?

## ‚úÖ **Explore Page EXISTS!**

**File Location:** `app/explore/page.tsx`
**URL:** `http://localhost:3000/explore`

---

## üîç **HOW TO ACCESS IT:**

### **Method 1: Direct URL** (Easiest)
Just type in your browser:
```
http://localhost:3000/explore
```

### **Method 2: Add to Navigation** (Recommended)

The explore page exists but isn't linked in your navigation. Here's how to add it:

**Option A: Replace "Search" with "Explore" in Mobile Nav**

In `components/layout/mobile-nav.tsx`, change:
```typescript
const navItems = [
  { href: "/feed", icon: Sparkles, label: "Home" },
  { href: "/explore", icon: Compass, label: "Explore" },  // Changed from /search
  { href: "/create", icon: Zap, label: "Create" },
  { href: "/reels", icon: Clapperboard, label: "Reels" },
  { href: "/profile", icon: UserCircle2, label: "Profile" },
]
```

**Option B: Keep Both (Add 6th button)**

Add explore as a 6th button:
```typescript
const navItems = [
  { href: "/feed", icon: Sparkles, label: "Home" },
  { href: "/explore", icon: Compass, label: "Explore" },
  { href: "/search", icon: Search, label: "Search" },
  { href: "/create", icon: Zap, label: "Create" },
  { href: "/reels", icon: Clapperboard, label: "Reels" },
  { href: "/profile", icon: UserCircle2, label: "Profile" },
]
```
