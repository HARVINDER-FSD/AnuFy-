## 📝 What Was Fixed

### Before
```typescript
// PostgreSQL query (WRONG for MongoDB)
const result = await query(
  `INSERT INTO posts (user_id, content, media_urls, media_type, location) 
   VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5)`,
  [userId, content, media_urls, media_type, location]
)
```

### After
```typescript
// MongoDB query (CORRECT)
const db = await getDatabase()
const postsCollection = db.collection('posts')

const postDoc = {
  user_id: new ObjectId(userId),
  content: content || null,
  media_urls: media_urls || null,
  media_type: media_type || 'text',
  location: location || null,
  is_archived: false,
  created_at: new Date(),
  updated_at: new Date()
}

const result = await postsCollection.insertOne(postDoc)
```

## ✅ Success Indicators

1. ✅ No errors in browser console
