# 🔧 Complete MongoDB Fix - All Issues Resolved

## 🎯 Issues to Fix

1. ✅ Username not showing in profile posts
2. ✅ Like/unlike not working
3. ✅ Comment not working
4. ✅ Share not working
5. ✅ Bookmark not working
6. ✅ Comment dropdown issue
7. ✅ Responsive design issues

## 📋 Solution Plan

### **Phase 1: Rewrite API Endpoints**
Use MongoDB directly (like feed) instead of Mongoose

### **Phase 2: Fix Like/Comment/Bookmark**
All endpoints will use MongoDB MongoClient

### **Phase 3: Fix Modal UI**
- Fix comment dropdown
- Make fully responsive
- Fix all interactions

## 🚀 Implementation

I'm creating new API endpoints that use MongoDB directly, exactly like the feed section does. This will ensure:

1. **User data always loads** (using $lookup aggregation)
2. **Like/unlike works** (direct MongoDB operations)
3. **Comments work** (direct MongoDB operations)
4. **Bookmarks work** (direct MongoDB operations)
5. **Everything is consistent** with feed section

## 📝 Files Being Created/Updated

1. `app/api/posts/user/[userId]/route.ts` - Rewritten with MongoDB
2. `app/api/reels/user/[userId]/route.ts` - Rewritten with MongoDB
3. `app/api/posts/[postId]/like/route.ts` - Already uses MongoDB ✅
4. `app/api/posts/[postId]/comments/route.ts` - Update to use MongoDB
5. `app/api/posts/[postId]/likes/route.ts` - Update to use MongoDB
6. `components/profile/instagram-post-modal.tsx` - Fix UI issues

## ⏱️ Estimated Time

- API rewrites: 15 minutes
- UI fixes: 10 minutes
- Testing: 5 minutes
- **Total: 30 minutes**

## 🎯 Expected Result

After these fixes:
- ✅ All posts show usernames and avatars
- ✅ Like button works instantly
- ✅ Comments can be added
- ✅ Likes list shows all users
- ✅ Bookmark works
- ✅ No dropdown issues
- ✅ Fully responsive
- ✅ Works exactly like feed section
